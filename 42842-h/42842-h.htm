<p class="center p2">EARLY EXPLORATIONS.</p>

<p>John Cabot was the first explorer of the coasts
of New England under British auspices. After
Columbus had discovered America, fabulous tales
were told of its outlying islands. The primitive
maps represented the Atlantic Ocean as full of
islands, some being very large, especially the Island
of Brazil, and the fabled Island of the Seven Cities.
The latter was said by sailors to be inhabited by
Christians who years before had fled from seven
cities of Asia, under their seven bishops, taking refuge
there. Bristol was then the leading English seaport,
and five years after the discovery by Columbus, John
Cabot started from it on a western voyage of exploration
in search of these famous islands. King
Henry VII. encouraged the enterprise, and in May,
1497, Cabot sailed in the little ship "Matthew," with
a crew of eighteen, and going westward he discovered
one of these islands, which he called the New Found
Land. It was Cape Breton Island, but being apparently
unproductive and without inhabitants, although
some signs of people were seen, he soon returned to
England. The greatest excitement followed his arrival
home, and the report got abroad that he had
discovered the Island of the Seven Cities and the
coast of Asia. Cabot became all the rage in England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
and a writer of that time records that Englishmen
called him "the Great Admiral," followed him
about "like madmen," that he was "dressed in silks,"
and "treated like a prince." Cabot, feeling his importance,
wanted his friends to share his good fortune,
so he appointed some of them governors, and others
bishops over the new world he had discovered, while
King Henry was so delighted at the success of the
voyage that he sent Cabot a letter of thanks and the
munificent present of £10. King Henry VII. was
always regarded as being "a little near."</p>

<p>In 1498, another and larger expedition was fitted
out, Cabot planning to sail westward until he reached
the land he had discovered in the previous year, and
then he thought by turning south he would come to
the Island of Cipango (Japan), where he would fill
his ships with spices and jewels, a half-dozen small
vessels making up the fleet. They took a more
northerly course than before, got among icebergs,
and where the summer days were so long there was
very little night. They reached Labrador, where
the sailors were frightened at the amount of ice, and
turning south, Cabot sailed along the American coast
nearly to Florida, once trying to plant a colony, but
being discouraged by the barren soil, abandoning it.
Yet sterile as the land might be, the waters were
filled with fish, so that Cabot called the country the
"Land of the Codfish," there was such an abundance
of them. The explorers recorded that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
bears were harmless, they could so easily get food,
describing how they would swim out into the sea and
catch the fish. Then Cabot disappeared from view.
Whether he died on the homeward voyage or after
he returned is unknown, as everything about his
subsequent career has faded from history. But his
two voyages were the foundation of the British
claim to the Atlantic coast from Labrador to Florida,
and the basis of all the English grants for the subsequently
formed American colonies.</p>

<p>Bartholomew Gosnold planted the first English
colony in the Old Bay State. Upon Friday, May 14,
1602, after elaborate preparations, he sailed from
Falmouth, England, in the ship "Concord," his party
numbering thirty-two, of whom about a dozen expected
to remain in the new country as settlers.
Crossing the ocean and coming into view of the
American coast, he steered south, soon finding his
progress barred by a bold headland, which encircled
him about. He had got into the bight of Cape Cod
Bay, and thus discovered that great bended, sandy
peninsula, to which he gave the name from the abundance
of codfish he found disporting in the waters.
Many whales were also seen, and vast numbers of
fish of all kinds. He tried to get out of the bay, and
coasting around the long and curiously hooked cape,
emerged into the Atlantic, and then coming down the
outer side got into Vineyard Sound, where he planted
his colony on Cuttyhunk Island, but soon abandoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
it. Gosnold returned to England, and in 1607 sailed
with Newport's expedition, carrying Captain John
Smith to Virginia.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE OLD COLONY.</p>

<p>The first English settlement permanently planted
in New England was the famous "Old Colony" at
Plymouth. The Puritan Separatists, from the Church
of England, sought refuge from English persecution
in Holland, living in Leyden under their pastor, John
Robinson, for eleven years, when they decided to
migrate to America. They arranged with the Virginia
Company to send them across the ocean, and
about the middle of the summer of 1620 the little
band of Pilgrims sailed from Delft-haven, the port of
Leyden, on the "Speedwell," in charge of Elder Brewster.
The "Mayflower" joined at Southampton with
other Puritans from England, but the "Speedwell"
sprung a leak and they put into Plymouth roads.
Then they decided to go on in the "Mayflower" alone,
and the party left Plymouth early in September.
They were seeking Virginia, but found the land,
after a voyage of over two months, at Cape Cod, anchoring
inside the Cape. Then they thanked God,
"who had brought them over the vast and furious
ocean, and delivered them from all the perils and
miseries thereof, again to set their feet on the firm
and stable earth." While the ship lay there, the
famous "Mayflower Compact" was drawn up, pledging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
the signers to obey the government that it established,
and John Carver was chosen the first Governor,
forty-one men signing the compact. After
nearly a month spent in exploration, their shallop
going all about the coasts, Plymouth was selected,
and the pioneers landed December 21, 1620, the day
being now annually celebrated as "Forefathers' Day."</p>

<p>Plymouth has a little land-locked harbor behind a
long and narrow sand beach, projected northward
from the ridge of Manomet below, this beach acting
as a protective breakwater to the wharves. The
harbor is so shallow, however, that there is little
trade by sea. The town spreads upon the bluff
shores, and on a plateau to the hills in the rear.
There is now a population of about nine thousand,
engaged mainly in manufacturing cordage and textiles,
and having a considerable fishery fleet. While
the town is of modern build, yet it is devoted to the
memory which gives it deathless fame, every relic of
the Pilgrims being restored and perpetuated. There
is little to be seen that comes from the olden time,
however, outside of the hills and harbor and original
streets, excepting the carefully cherished relics of the
"Mayflower's" passengers, that have been gathered
together. The choice of Plymouth as the landing-place
seems to have been mainly from necessity, when protracted
explorations failed to find a better place, and
the coming of winter compelled a landing somewhere.
The actual location was hardly well considered, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Pilgrims themselves being far from satisfied. After
the "Mayflower" anchored inside of Cape Cod, several
weeks were passed in explorations, and finally, upon
a Sunday in December, 1620, a landing was made
upon Clark's Island, where religious services were
held, the first in New England. Upon the most elevated
part of this island stands a huge boulder, about
twelve feet high, called from some local circumstance
the "Election Rock." Its face bears the words taken
from <i>Mourt's Relation</i>, which chronicled the voyage
of the "Mayflower":</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Upon the Sabbath-Day wee rested, 20 December, 1620."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Eighteen of the Pilgrims thus "rested," after their
shallop, in making the shore, had been almost shipwrecked.
The next day they sailed across the bay to
the mainland, their first landing being then made at
Plymouth, and upon the second day, December 22d,
the entire company came ashore and the settlement
began.</p>

<p>Within the Pilgrim Hall, a fireproof building upon
the chief street, are kept the precious relics of the
"Mayflower" and the Pilgrims, with paintings of the
embarkation from Delft-haven and landing at Plymouth,
and old portraits of the leaders of the colony.
Among the interesting documents are autograph writings,
establishing a chain of acquaintanceship connecting
the original Pilgrims with the present time.
Peregrine White was the first child of the new colony,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
the infant being born on the "Mayflower" after she
came into Cape Cod Bay, in November, 1620, and
he was only a month old when they landed. The
baby, surviving all their hardships, lived to a ripe old
age, and "Grandfather Cobb," born in 1694, knew
him well. Cobb, in his day, lived to be the oldest
man in New England, his life covering space in three
centuries, for he exceeded one hundred and seven
years, dying in 1801. William R. Sever, born in
1790, knew Cobb and recollected him well, and living
until he was ninety-seven years old, died in 1887.
These three lives connected the Pilgrim landing
almost with the present day. The old cradle that
rocked Peregrine White on the "Mayflower," and after
they landed, is preserved&mdash;an upright, stiff-backed,
wicker-work basket, upon rude wooden rockers.
One of the chief paintings represents the signing of
the memorable "Mayflower Compact." There are
also in the hall some of the old straight-backed chairs
of the Pilgrims, with their pots and platters, and
among other relics Miles Standish's sword. In the
court-house are the original records of the colony,
the first allotment of lands among the settlers, their
deeds, agreements and wills, and the patent given the
colony by Earl Warwick in 1629. There are also
shown in quaint handwriting, with the ink partly
faded out, records of how they divided their cattle,
when it was decided to change from the original plan
of holding them in common. Signatures of the Pilgrims
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
are attached to many of these documents.
Governor Carver died the first year, William Bradford
succeeding, and there is preserved in Governor
Bradford's writing the famous order establishing trial
by jury in the colony.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE PLYMOUTH ROCK.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The breaking waves dashed high</p>
<p>On a stern and rock-bound coast."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Thus begins Mrs. Hemans' beautiful hymn on the
landing of the Pilgrims. Unfortunately for the poetry,
however, sand is everywhere about, and scarcely a
rock or boulder can be seen for miles, excepting the
very little one on which they landed. Down near
the water-side is this sacred stone, worshipped by all
the Pilgrim descendants, the retrocession of the sea
having left it some distance back. It is a gray
syenite boulder, oval-shaped, and about six feet
long. It was some time ago unfortunately split, and
the parts have been cemented together. At the time
of the landing this boulder lay on the sandy beach,
partly embedded, being almost solitary on these
sands, for unlike the verge of Manomet to the southward,
and the coast north of Boston, this sandy shore
is almost without rocks of any kind. Dropped
here in the glacial period, and lying partly in the
water, the rock made a boat-landing naturally attractive
to the water-weary Pilgrims when they coasted
along in their shallop from Clark's Island, so they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
stepped out upon it to get ashore dry-shod. The
rock is in its original location, but has been elevated
several feet to a higher level, is surmounted by an
imposing granite canopy, and is railed in for protection
from the relic-hunter. The numerals "1620"
are rudely carved upon its side, and a sort of fissure
in its face seems like the impress of a foot. Surmounting
the canopy is a scallop shell, the distinctive
emblem of the pilgrim. The scallop has been called
the "Butterfly of the Sea," and in the time of the
Crusades, a scallop shell fastened in the cap denoted
that the wearer had made a pilgrimage to the Holy
Land. Thus it is said in the <i>Hermit</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"He quits his cell, the pilgrim staff he bore,</p>
<p>And fixed his scallop in his hat before."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Behind the Plymouth Rock rises the bluff shore
into Cole's Hill, having its steep slopes sodded, this
having been the place up which the Pilgrims climbed
after the landing. A view to the front shows the
wharves, and across the bay the narrow sandspit protecting
the harbor, while on the right hand is the
long ridge of Manomet, and over the water to the
left appear distant sand-dunes along Duxbury Beach.
Off to the northward rises the "Captain's Hill" of
Duxbury, surmounted with the monument to Captain
Miles Standish, erected in 1889, rising one hundred
and ten feet. Upon Cole's Hill was the first burial-place
of the Pilgrims, and here were interred about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
half the intrepid band, who died from the privations
of the first winter. Their bones were occasionally
washed out by heavy rains, or found in digging for
the foundations of buildings, but all have been carefully
collected, and, with several of the dead thus exposed,
were again entombed in the canopy over
Plymouth Rock. A little way to the southward is
Leyden Street, running from the water's edge for
some distance back up the slope to the side of the
"Burial Hill," the first cemetery. This was the
earliest highway laid out in New England, although
it did not receive its present name until long afterwards.
Upon this street the Pilgrims built their first
rude houses, the lots extending southward from it to
the "Town Brook," a short distance beyond, which
supplied them with good water, and was the chief
feature inducing them to select this place for settlement.</p>

<p>The story of their landing is told in <i>Mourt's Relation</i>,
written by one of the actors in this great historical
drama. After describing their explorations
and hasty selection of the place, he continues: "So,
in the morning, after we had called on God for direction,
we came to this resolution, to go presently
ashore again, and to take a better view of two places
which we thought most fitting for us; for we could
not now take time for further search or consideration,
our victuals being much spent, especially our beer,
and it being now the 19th of December. After our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
landing and viewing the places so well as we could,
we came to a conclusion, by most voices, to set on a
high ground, where there is a great deal of land
cleared, and hath been planted with corn three or
four years ago; and there is a very sweet brook runs
under the hillside, and many delicate springs of as
good water as can be drunk, and where we may harbor
our shallops and boats exceeding well; and in
this brook fish in their season; on the further side
of the river also much corn-ground cleared. In one
field is a great hill on which we point to make a
platform and plant our ordnance, which will command
all around about. From thence we may see into the
bay and far into the sea, and we may see thence
Cape Cod. Our greatest labor will be the fetching
of our wood, which is half a quarter of an English
mile; but there is enough so far off. What people
inhabit here we know not, for as yet we have seen
none. So there we made our rendezvous, and a
place for some of our people, about twenty, resolving
in the morning to come all ashore and to build
houses." About a week after landing they began
constructing their first fort on the hill, and allotted
the plots of land on their street, subsequently named
Leyden. Thus the town was begun, and behind it
rose two hills, the one now known as the Burial Hill
being at the head of this street, and elevated about
one hundred and fifty feet above the sea. Miles
Standish, with his military eye, for he had seen veteran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
service in Flanders, selected this hill for the
fort, and here in 1622 was built the square timber
block-house that made them both a fort and a church,
the entire settlement as it then existed being enclosed
with a stockade for further protection. This caused
the hill to be named Fort Hill, and it was not until
long afterward that it was used as a cemetery and
called Burial Hill, the first interred being some of
the original Pilgrims after the graveyard on Cole's
Hill, down by the waterside, had been abandoned.</p>

<p>Upon Fort Hill was built the "Watch House,"
where an outlook was kept for the Indians. Stones now
mark the locations both of the fort and the watchhouse,
and surrounding them are the graves of several
of the "Mayflower" Pilgrims, with many of their
descendants, the dark slate gravestones having been
brought out from England. There is a fine outlook
from Burial Hill, far over the sea to the distant yellow
sand-streak of Cape Cod. About a half-mile
northward is the other hill, rising somewhat higher,
and upon it is the National Monument to the Pilgrims,
dedicated in 1889. This is a massive granite pedestal
forty-five feet high, surmounted by the largest
stone statue in existence, a colossal figure of Faith,
thirty-six feet high, and adorned by large seated
statues emblematic of the principles upon which the
settlement was founded, representing Law, Morality,
Freedom and Education. Upon this great monument
are also representations of the landing of the Pilgrims,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
their names, and the "Mayflower Compact." It was
into this infant colony of Plymouth, after some weeks
of careful parley and investigation, there strode the
stalwart Indian Samoset, making their acquaintance
and paving the way for the subsequent treaty and
alliance with Massasoit, which for many years was
scrupulously observed by both parties, and not broken
until after he died. Canonicus, of the Narragansetts,
to the southward, sent to the colony after Massasoit's
death a sheaf of arrows bound with a rattlesnake's
skin as a token of hostility. Governor Bradford did
not want war, but he knew they must maintain a
brave outlook, so he promptly filled the skin with
powder and shot and sent it back to Canonicus, who
understood the grim challenge, and fearing the deadly
musketry, prudently restrained the hostile instincts
of his tribe. The privations of the first year, which
killed half the settlers, and were only relieved by
succor from England, are said to have originated the
New England Thanksgiving Festival Day, which has
since spread over the whole country. In December,
1621, they had their first Thanksgiving, upon the
arrival of a relief ship from abroad. Such was the
dawning of the ruling race of the American nation.</p>

<p class="center p2">DUXBURY AND MILES STANDISH.</p>

<p>Upon the upper side of Plymouth Bay, enclosing
its northern portion, is one of those long peninsulas
of sand and rocks, abounding upon the Massachusetts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
coasts, which projects about six miles southeastward
into the sea and terminates in a high knob, called the
Gurnet, with a hook turned inward. This elongated
sand-strip is Duxbury Beach, the town of Duxbury
being upon the mainland inside, a fishing village
probably best known as the terminus of the French
Atlantic Cable. It was at Duxbury that the first
regular pastor was Ralph Partridge, whom Cotton
Mather described as having "the innocence of a dove
and the loftiness of an eagle." The Pilgrims allotted
this district to Miles Standish and to their youngest
member, John Alden. Standish named it from Duxbury
Hall, in Lancashire, the seat of his English ancestors.
The brave Miles was not a Puritan and did
not belong to their church, but as he was an experienced
warrior, they made him the commander of their
standing army of twelve men. Is is said that there
have been only two renowned military chieftains in
history who were personally acquainted with all their
soldiers&mdash;Julius Cæsar and Miles Standish. The redoubtable
old captain lost his wife Rose soon after
the landing, and he then engaged the fascinating and
youthful Alden to do his courtship for him and woo
the gentle Priscilla Mullins, with the usual result that
the maiden preferred the more attractive Alden to
the grim old soldier. Standish has been described as
"a short man, very brave, but impetuous and
choleric, and his name soon became a terror to all
hostile Indians." His is the romance of early Plymouth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
for he has been made the hero of Longfellow's
poem, and of renowned operas and many New England
tales, while the fair Priscilla gave her name to
the great Long Island Sound steamer. Standish
lived upon the "Captain's Hill," out on the Duxbury
peninsula, the highest land thereabout, rising one
hundred and eighty feet, upon a broad point projecting
into Plymouth Bay. His monument is near the
site of his house upon the bare-topped, oval-shaped
hill, a rather bleak place, however, to have selected
for a home. Beyond it the projecting Duxbury
Beach ends in the high Gurnet, with twin lighthouses,
and then hooks inward to another bold terminating
bulb, the headland of Saquish. To the northward is
Clark's Island, where the Pilgrims first landed, a similarly
round-topped mass rising from the water. Thus
is Plymouth Bay environed, for to the southward its
long guarding ridge on that side, Manomet, projects
far into the sea.</p>

<p class="center p2">CAPE COD.</p>

<p>The Old Bay State presents a front to the rough
Atlantic like a gladiator at bay. She has in Cape
Cod one defensive forearm boldly extended, and she
likewise is prepared, if necessary, to thrust out the
other, which keeps close guard upon her rugged granite
breast in Cape Ann. These capes are the portals
of Massachusetts Bay, and of the ocean entrance to
Boston. Everyone, in viewing the map, marvels at
the extraordinary formation of Cape Cod. Thoreau,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
who in days gone by tramped all over the Cape, says,
"A man may stand there and put all America behind
him." This great sandy headland stretches eastward
from the mainland at Sandwich about thirty miles,
then turns north and northwest thirty miles more,
finally terminating in a huge hook, bent around to
the south and east again, and forming the spacious
landlocked harbor of Provincetown. At Harwich
and Chatham the elbow sharply bends, the shoulder
is at Buzzard's Bay, the wrist at Truro, and the
closing fingers make Provincetown's haven. The
Cape is nearly all white sand, with boulders occasionally
appearing, particularly near the extremity.
Thin layers of soil extend as far as Truro, but the
sand is seen through many rents, and the extremity
is completely bare, being a wilderness of sand, kept
in partial motion by the winds, and making constantly
shifting dunes. The prevalent northeast
winds and surf are regarded as having made the
hooked end of the Cape by gradually moving the
sands upon the shore around to the west and south.
This hooked end impressed the Colonial navigators,
and the ancient Dutch maps call it Staaten Hoeck,
and the enclosed waters Staaten Bay. The extremely
white sand, in contrast with the darker
rocks of more northern shores, led Champlain to
name it Cape Blanc. Gosnold, as already announced,
from the abundance of codfish named it Cape Cod,
whereof the faithful historian, Cotton Mather, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
records the fact, writes naïvely that he supposes it
will never lose its name "till swarms of codfish be
seen swimming on the highest hills."</p>

<p>This remarkable cape came near being an island,
Buzzard's Bay on the south and Cape Cod bay on
the north being so deeply indented that their waters
approach within about seven miles. The isthmus is
a low, broad alluvial valley stretching between, having
Monumet River flowing from Herring Pond south
into Buzzard's Bay, and the Scusset River north
from the divide, their headwaters only a thousand
yards apart, so that this narrow neck of land, nowhere
elevated more than twenty-five feet, is all that saves
the famous Cape from being an island. A canal was
projected there as early as 1676, and the proposed
"Cape Cod Ship Canal" has been regularly agitated
ever since, and may at some time be constructed,
saving the shipping from the long detour around the
Cape. This neck has been called "the collar of the
Cape," and beyond was the Indian domain of Monomoy.
Chatham then was Nauset, and Barnstable was
Cummaquid, these, as indeed every village on the
Cape, being famous nurseries of sailors and fishermen.
Here is some agriculture, the farms and towns
having roomy old houses, and the extensive cranberry
bogs showing one of the chief industries of the people.
Along the southern shore are Marshpee, Cotuit,
and Hyannis, all changing from fishing-ports to
modern fashionable watering-places. The surface is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
composed of sharply defined hills of white sand, having
broad sandy levels between that are almost desert
plains. There are some trees, but the growth becomes
gradually stunted, as the journey is made out
upon the Cape, and villages are less frequent and
population sparser. Modern cottages crown the hilltops,
and the frequent cranberry bogs are as level as
a floor, being thickly grown with the myriad runners
and sombre foliage of the prolific plant.</p>

<p>Passing Yarmouth and Harwich, the railway turns
northward at the elbow of the cape, where Chatham
is on the ocean shore. Brewster is northward, and
Eastham, noted for its fortified church, whose colonial
pastor received by law, for his salary, part of every
stranded whale coming upon the shore. To the left
is Welfleet, on the bay shore, and to the right the
triple lighthouses of Nauset Beach, in front of which
the ocean tides divide, moving in opposite directions,
one current south to Nantucket Sound, and the other
north, to go around the Cape into Massachusetts
Bay. Northward is the sandy desert of Truro, the
"Dangerfield" of early days, regarded as the most
fatal coast in New England. This town of Truro
has been described as "a village where its able-bodied
men are all ploughing the ocean together as
a common field," while in North Truro "the women
and girls may sit at their doors and see where their
husbands and brothers are harvesting their mackerel
fifteen to twenty miles off on the sea, with hundreds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
of white harvest-wagons." Here, upon the high
hill making the ocean shore, where the headland
curves from north around to the west, is the guardian
beacon of Cape Cod, the lofty Highland Light, forty-one
miles southeast of Boston Light, and whose powerful
white rays shine for twenty miles over the
ocean without, and the bay within. The tower stands
on a hill one hundred and forty-two feet high, and
the light is elevated nearly two hundred feet. Along
here Thoreau walked on the "sand-bar in the midst
of the sea," and as he gazed far over the ocean, thus
reflected: "The nearest beach to us on the east was
on the coast of Galicia in Spain, whose capital is
Santiago, though by old poets' reckoning it should
have been Atlantis, or the Hesperides; but Heaven
is found to be farther west now. At first we were
abreast of that part of Portugal <i>entre Douro e Mino</i>,
and then Galicia and the port of Pontevedro opened
to us as we walked along, but we did not enter, the
breakers ran so high. The bold headland of Cape
Finisterre, a little north of east, jutted toward us
next with its vain brag; for we flung back 'Here is
Cape Cod, Cape Land's Beginning.' A little indentation
toward the north&mdash;for the land loomed to our
imaginations like a common mirage&mdash;we knew was
the Bay of Biscay, and we sang, 'There we lay, till
next day, in the Bay of Biscay, O!' A little south
of east was Palos, where Columbus weighed anchor,
and further yet the pillars which Hercules set up."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">THE PURITAN COMPACT.</p>

<p>At the extremity of Cape Cod is Provincetown,
among the sand dunes, a town with about forty-five
hundred inhabitants, encircling the harbor on its
western verge, a long, narrow settlement between
the high white sand-hills and the beach. There are
two main streets, one along the beach and the other
parallel to it back among the hills. Upon the highest
hill is the Town Hall, the mariner's landmark entering
the harbor, and from it are good views over
ocean and bay, displaying the curious end of the
Cape sweeping grandly around and enclosing the
spacious harbor with room enough for anchoring an
enormous fleet. To the west and south is the great
bended hook having Race Point on its northwesterly
verge and a lighthouse on the southern termination,
whence a tongue of beach juts over towards Truro.
This is a haven for many fishermen, and the people,
who are among the purest descendants of the original
Puritans, devote their energies largely to catching
mackerel and cod, curing and stacking the fish all
around the bay. The first appearance of Provincetown
in history was when the "Mayflower" entered
the harbor with the Pilgrims in November, 1620.
Cape Cod was the first land they saw after leaving the
English Channel, then not bare as now, but wooded
down to the shore. They anchored in the bay, and
the men were forced to wade "a bow-shoot" to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
shore to make a landing, and it was this wading and
subsequent exposure which gave them the colds and
sickness resulting in the deaths of so many during
the subsequent winter. It is recorded that upon
Monday, November 23, 1620, the women went ashore
to wash, and thus they inaugurated that universal institution
which has extended all over the country,
the great American Monday washing-day. It was
while anchored in Provincetown harbor the Pilgrims
framed and signed the celebrated Puritan Compact,
so long ruling Plymouth, which is regarded as the
foundation of constitutional government. John
Quincy Adams said of it: "This is perhaps the
only instance in human history of that positive original
social compact which speculative philosophers
imagined as the only legitimate source of government."
It was signed by forty-one Pilgrims, of
whom twenty-one died during the ensuing four
months. It reads:</p>

<p>"In the name of God, amen. We, whose names
are underwritten, the loyal subjects of our direct
sovereign lord King James, by the grace of God, of
Great Britain, France and Ireland, King, Defender
of the Faith, etc., having undertaken, for the glory
of God and advancement of the Christian faith and
honor of our King and country, a voyage to plant
the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia, do
by these presents solemnly and mutually, in the presence
of God and of one another, covenant and combine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
ourselves together into a civil body politic, for
our better ordering and preservation, and furtherance
of the ends aforesaid; and by virtue hereof to
enact, constitute and frame such just and equal laws,
ordinances, acts, constitutions and offices, from time
to time, as shall be thought most meet and expedient
for the general good of the colony; unto which we
promise all due submission and obedience. In witness
whereof, we have hereunder inscribed our names
at Cape Cod, the 11th day of November (old style),
in the year of the reign of our sovereign lord King
James, of England, France and Ireland, the 18th,
and of Scotland, the 54th, Anno Domini, 1620."</p>

<p>Provincetown was a long time afterwards started,
and began with a few fishermen's huts, which grew
in the eighteenth century to a small village with extensive
fish-drying flakes. The people top-dressed
the soft sands with clay, shells and pebble, thus
making the streets. There are relics of wrecks all
about the extremity of the Cape, and it has had a
sad history, though now, being better lighted and
having life-saving stations, these terrible disasters are
rare. The town has become an attractive summer
resort, and has quite a development of pleasant
homes. The visitor mounts High Pole Hill to get the
view, and all around it is over the sea, for, gaze
whither one may as the winds blow freshly across
the Cape, the scene is of dazzling white sand or
deeply blue water.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">APPROACHING MASSACHUSETTS BAY.</p>

<p>From Plymouth Harbor northward to Massachusetts
Bay is but a short distance. Inland from the
coast-line the land rises into the noted "Blue Hills
of Milton," their highest dome-like summit elevated
six hundred and fifty feet and surmounted by an Observatory.
These are granite hills, having the picturesque
town of Quincy stretching down to the sea,
with a broad fringe of salt marshes in front. Thus
are named the "Quincy granites," famous for building,
and it was to get these huge stones out that the
earliest rude railway in New England was constructed
in 1826, a line three miles long to Neponset
River, the cars being drawn by horses. It is said
by the geologists that these hills of Milton are an
older formation than the Alps, and their earliest English
name, designated by King Charles I., was the
Cheviot Hills. Among the salt marshes just north
of Duxbury is Marshfield, the home of Daniel Webster,
whose remains lie in an ancient graveyard on
an ocean-viewing hill not far away. Beside him are
the graves of his sons&mdash;Edward, killed in the Mexican
War, and Fletcher, killed at Bull Run in the
Civil War. An ornamental villa has replaced his
old house, which was burnt, and the homestead has
gone to strangers. Close by Webster's is the grave
of the early Pilgrim Governor Winslow, whose
quaint old dwelling is near. Quincy is famous as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the home of the greatest families of the original
colony of Massachusetts Bay&mdash;Quincy and Adams.
The antique church of Quincy, known as the Adams
Temple, has in the yard the graves of the two Presidents
Adams, father and son. John Hancock, whose
bold signature leads the Congress in the Declaration
of Independence, was a native of Quincy. It was
among the earliest Massachusetts settlements, having
been colonized by a number of Episcopalians at
Merry Mount, who were such jovial people that the
strict Puritans of Plymouth were aghast at their
goings on, and sent Miles Standish with the whole
army against them, and capturing the leaders shipped
them prisoners back to England. This severe treatment
was administered a second time before they
were subdued. Thomas Morton, who was among
those twice banished, wrote the <i>New England Canaan</i>,
giving this curious account of the aborigines:
"The Indians may be rather accompted as living
richly, wanting nothing that is needful, and to be
commended for leading a contented life, the younger
being ruled by the elder and the elder ruled by the
Powahs, and the Powahs are ruled by the Devill;
and then you may imagine what good rule is like to
be amongst them." This theory was generally prevalent
among the early colonists, for Cotton Mather
was convinced that "the Indians are under the
special protection of the Devill."</p>

<p>The coast, as Massachusetts Bay is approached,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
rises into the rocky shores of Scituate and Cohasset.
Here is the dangerous reef of Minot's Ledge in the
offing, guarded by the leading beacon of the New
England waters, about four miles from the shore.
The original lighthouse was washed away in a terrific
storm in April, 1851. The catastrophe occurred in
the night, when those on shore heard a violent tolling
of the lighthouse bell, and in the morning the tower
was gone, with all the light keepers, the only relic
being a chair washed ashore, which was recognized
as one that had been in the watch-room of the tower.
Scituate was the birthplace of Samuel Woodworth,
author of the <i>Old Oaken Bucket</i>. These shores are
all lined with villas and attractive coast resorts, and
the noted Jerusalem Road is the chief highway of
Cohasset, following the coast-line around to the westward.
Here projects the narrow and strange peninsula
of Nantasket Beach, five miles out into the sea
to Point Allerton, then hooking around and terminating
in the town of Hull, and making one of the most
popular seaside resorts of Bostonians. Farther to the
westward, behind it, is Hingham Harbor, the quaint
old village of Hingham on its shores, settled in 1635,
having the oldest occupied church in New England,
dating from 1681. This most ancient church of
Yankeedom is a square building of the colonial style,
its steep roof sloping up on all four sides to a platform
at the top surrounded by a balustrade and surmounted
by a little pointed belfry. Still farther
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
westward, and within the entrance to Boston Harbor,
projects the bold bluff of Squantum, thrust out into
the bay, it having been named in memory of the old
sachem who ruled all the country round about when
Boston was first colonized, his home being on an adjacent
hill. Sturdy old Squantum was a firm friend of
the colonists, and when he was dying he besought
Governor Bradford to pray for him, "that he might
go to the Englishman's God in Heaven."</p>

<p class="center p2">THE CITY OF BOSTON.</p>

<p>The approach to the New England metropolis, especially
by way of the harbor, is fine. The city rises
gradually ridge above ridge, until the centre culminates
in Beacon Hill, surmounted by the bright gilded
dome and lantern-top of the Massachusetts State
House. From all sides the land, with its varied surfaces
of hill and vale, slopes down towards the water
courses, leading into the deep indentation of Boston
Harbor. The pear-shaped peninsula, forming the
original town, was the Indian Shawmut, or the
"sweet waters," a name reproduced in many ways in
the modern city. William Blackstone, the recluse
Anglican clergyman of London who could not get
on there with the "Lords Bishops" and emigrated,
was the first white inhabitant of Shawmut, coming in
1623. Governor John Winthrop, of the Massachusetts
colony, who came out in 1630 to Salem, removed
to Shawmut the same year with Thomas Dudley and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
a number of Puritans, crossing over from Charlestown
in a search for good water, which led them to
select this place, which, from its three hills, they
called the Tri-mountain, since shortened into Tremont.
Blackstone, having lived there in solitude for
several years, soon tired of having such near neighbors,
and in 1634 he sold out the whole town site to
them for about $150, and being disgusted with these
"Lords Brethren," as he had previously been with
the "Lords Bishops," avoided controversy by going
farther into the wilderness. Winthrop and Dudley
had come originally from Boston in England, and
making this the capital of the Massachusetts colony,
they gave it that name. The English Boston in Lincolnshire
grew around the monastery of the Saxon
St. Botolph, established in the seventh century, and
hence its name of Botolph's Town, which has been
condensed into Boston. Some years ago the English
Bostonians presented a Gothic window from the ruins
of old St. Botolph's to Trinity Episcopal Church in
Boston. When this Massachusetts colony was originally
established, one of Winthrop's depressed companions,
writing home, described Shawmut as "a
hideous wilderness possessed by barbarous Indians,
very cold, sickly, rocky, barren, unfit for culture, and
like to keep the people miserable." Yet the settlement
grew, and, as an early historian says, "Philadelphia
was a forest and New York was an insignificant
village long after its rival, Boston, had become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
a great commercial town." In 1663 an English visitor,
describing the place, wrote that "the buildings
are handsome, joining one to the other, as in London,
with many large streets, most of them paved with
pebble-stones. In the high street toward the Common
there are faire houses, some of stone." The
young colony encouraged commerce and became possessed
of many ships, the earliest built at Boston
being the bark "Blessing of the Bay" of thirty tons,
a noted vessel belonging to Governor Winthrop, and
considered a wonder in her time. The first solid
wharf was built in 1673. It was Governor Winthrop
who put into one of his official messages this chunk
of wisdom: "The best part of a community is always
the least, and of that part the wiser are still less."
Anterior to the Revolution, Boston was the largest
and most important American city, then having
twenty-five thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>Boston Harbor covers about seventy-five square
miles, having various arms, such as South Boston Bay
and Dorchester Bay, and the estuaries of the Charles,
Mystic and Neponset Rivers, which enlarge the
landing-spaces. The outer harbor has great natural
beauty, increased by the improvements and adornments
of buildings, the water surface gradually narrowing
towards the city, and dotted with craggy, undulating
islands, having long stretches of bordering
beaches, interspersed with jutting cliffs, broad and
bold promontories, and both low and lofty shores. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
adjacent coasts are lined with villages that gradually
merge into the suburbs of the great city. In this
spacious harbor there are at least fifty large and small
islands, and most of these, which were bare in Winthrop's
day, are now crowned with forts, lighthouses,
almshouses, hospitals and other civic institutions,
several being most striking edifices, giving a pleasing
variety to the scene. The splendid guiding beacon
for the harbor entrance stands upon Little Brewster
or Lighthouse Island, at the northern edge of Nantasket
Roads. This is Boston Light, elevated about
one hundred feet, a revolving light visible sixteen
miles. George's Island, near the entrance and commanding
the approach from the sea, has upon it the
chief defensive work of the harbor, Fort Warren,
about two miles west of Boston Light. Farther in,
and near the city, off South Boston, is Castle Island,
with Fort Independence, the successor of the earliest
Boston fort, the "Castle," built by Winthrop in 1634.
Opposite and about one mile northward is Governor's
Island, containing Fort Winthrop. This island was
originally the "Governor's garden," and Winthrop
paid a yearly rent of two bushels of apples for it.
These forts are nearly all constructed of Quincy
granite, but none has seen actual warfare. Long
Island spreads its high crags across the harbor, outside
of the inner forts, and has a lighthouse on its
northern end, while to the eastward is a low, rocky
islet, bearing as a warning to the mariner a curious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
stone monument, known as Nix's Mate. It was here
the colonists used to hang the pirates caught on the
New England coasts. Upon Deer and Rainsford
Islands are hospitals and reformatories, and upon
Thompson's Island, which is fantastically shaped like
an unfledged chicken, is an asylum and farm-school
for indigent boys. Spectacle, Half Moon and Apple
Islands received their names from their shapes.</p>

<p>At the inward, western extremity of the harbor is
the pear-shaped Shawmut peninsula of Boston,
having water ways almost all around it. Upon the
one side is South Boston and upon the other Charlestown,
the comparatively narrow intervening water
courses of Fort Point Channel and Charles River
being in parts nearly roofed over with bridges, that
grudgingly open their draws to let through the vessels
laden with lumber and coal. To the northeast,
upon another peninsula, which formerly was an
island, is East Boston, having Chelsea beyond to the
northward. Towards the west, across the broadened
estuary of Charles River, is Cambridge, this
part of the estuary known as the Back Bay having
been largely encroached upon to create more land
for the crowded and spreading city. To the southward
are Roxbury and Dorchester, and to the westward
Brookline, Brighton and Somerville. Upon the
Shawmut peninsula, the original city of Boston covered
only seven hundred and eighty-three acres, but
by the reclamations this has been more than doubled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
It absorbed Dorchester Neck to enlarge South Boston;
took in Noddle's Island for East Boston; and
annexed about all the other suburbs, so that the city
now covers forty-three square miles. The hills have
been partly levelled and the whole face of the ancient
town altered, these improvements and the great
changes wrought by fires obliterating the older narrow
and crooked streets, having thus wrought a complete
transformation. The alignments of the colonial
maps can now hardly be recognized, and scarcely a
vestige, beyond the three old burying-grounds and a
few buildings, remains of primitive Boston. When
the first settlers coming from Charlestown saw Shawmut
or the Tri-mountain, it seemed to chiefly consist
of the three high hills which they called Copp's,
Beacon and Fort Hills, the highest of these, the
Beacon, being itself a sort of tri-mountain, having
three well-developed surmounting little peaks. These,
however, were afterwards cut down, although the
massive elevation of Beacon Hill, whereon the colonists
burnt their signal-fires, remains the crowning
glory of the peninsula.</p>

<p class="center p2">BOSTON COMMON.</p>

<p>The city of Boston has a population of six hundred
thousand, and the centre around which it clusters
is the well-known Boston Common, set apart in
1634, and always jealously reserved for public uses,
the surface rising upon its northern verge towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Beacon Hill. No matter by what route approached,
the city has the appearance of a broad cone with a
wide-spreading base, ascending gradually to the bulb-like
apex of the gilded State House dome. Occasionally
a tall building looms above the mass, or it is
surmounted by church-spires and the fanciful towers
of modern construction, or by a high chimney pouring
out black smoke; but it is a symmetrical scene
in the general view, though in many parts the surface
of the actual city is very uneven. The Common
rises towards the State House from the south
and west by a graceful plane interspersed with hillocks.
It is crossed by many pleasant walks, and
has broad open spaces used for sports and military
displays. It is rich in noble old trees, and covers
nearly fifty acres, while to the westward is an additional
level park of half the size, known as the
Public Garden, separated by a wide street accommodating
the cross-town traffic. This noted Boston
Common was the ancient Puritan pasture-ground,
and it is rich in traditions. In the colonial wars, the
captured hostile Indians were put to death here, their
grinning heads impaled on stakes for a public warning.
Murderers were gibbeted, witches burnt and
duels fought here. The impassioned George Whitefield,
in the middle of the eighteenth century, preached
here to a congregation of twenty thousand. An English
traveller in the late seventeenth century described
the place as "a small but pleasant Common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
where the gallants, a little before sunset, walk with
their marmalet-madams till the bell at nine o'clock
rings them home." Sometimes it was a fortified
camp, and it was always a pleasure-ground, while
during the great fire of 1872, which destroyed the
chief business section with property valued at $70,000,000,
enormous piles of hastily saved goods filled
the eastern portions next to Tremont Street, bounding
it on that side. Beacon Street is the northern
border and Boylston Street the southern, there being
rows of stately elms upon the walks along these
streets and the pathways leading across the Common
in various directions.</p>

<p>Flagstaff Hill, the most prominent eminence, near
the centre of the Common, is surmounted by the
Soldiers' Monument, rising ninety feet, with a colossal
statue of America on the apex, overlooking the
city. It was designed by Milmore, and is one of the
most imposing memorials of the Civil War in the
country. Nearby stood the "Old Elm," which was
much older than the city, and was blown down in
1876. The adjacent sheet of water is the noted
"Frog Pond" of colonial memory, and dear to the
hearts of all old Bostonians. Near the northeastern
boundary the Brewer Fountain, famous for its magnificent
bronzes, the munificent gift of a prominent
citizen, pours out its limpid waters. A colossal
equestrian statue of Washington adorns the Public
Garden. These attractive grounds are additionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
embellished by tasteful little lakes, statues and lovely
floral displays. On the southern side of the Common
is the old Central Burying-Ground, which contains
the grave of Gilbert Stuart, the portrait painter,
who died in 1828. Beneath the edge of the Common
on the southern and eastern sides is the great Subway,
which crosses Boston, giving needed relief to
the congested traffic, and was completed in 1898 at
a cost of nearly $5,000,000, a most commodious,
airy and well-lighted tunnel, accommodating many
lines of electric cars, and providing speedy transit
across the crowded city.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE STATE HOUSE.</p>

<p>The famous Boston State House, fronting on Beacon
Street at the summit of the hill, stands upon
ground which, in the eighteenth century, was John
Hancock's cow-pasture, his residence, for many years
alongside, having been replaced by the ornamental
"swell-fronts" of the Somerset Club. This rounded
construction, known as the swell-front, is a distinctive
feature of the old-time Boston residential
architecture, and in many buildings the effect is
heightened by the luxuriant overrunning vines of the
Boston ivy, which is especially fine in the autumn.
A Corinthian portico fronts the State House, which
was built about the beginning of the nineteenth century,
but has since been repeatedly enlarged, the
latest extension being completed in 1898, so that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
whole building is now four hundred by two hundred
and twelve feet, the lantern on the dome rising one
hundred and fifty feet. Upon the terrace in front
are statues of Daniel Webster and Horace Mann.
The eastern side of the last extension has a small
park, and here, on top of Beacon Hill, has been
erected a reproduction, practically on the original
site, of the Beacon Monument, which was put there
in 1790 to commemorate the success of the Revolution,
but was removed in 1812. Within the State
House is the Memorial Hall, containing the battle-flags
of Massachusetts regiments and other historical
relics. Portraits, busts and statues of the great men
of Massachusetts adorn the interior rooms. From
the lantern surmounting the dome is the finest view
of Boston, with the mass of estuaries penetrating the
land on all sides, the harbor and islands, and over the
neighboring country for many miles. In the Representatives'
Chamber hangs, high on the wall, one of
the precious relics of the Old Bay State, the noted
carved codfish, typifying a great industry. In the
original State House preceding this one, down on
Washington Street, in the heart of the older town,
on March 17, 1785, Representative Rowe&mdash;who is
also said to have been the suggester of throwing the
tea overboard in Boston harbor&mdash;according to the
minutes moved, "That leave might be given to hang
up the representation of a codfish in the room where
the House sit, as a memorial of the importance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
cod-fishery to the welfare of the Commonwealth, as
had been usual formerly." Leave was accordingly
given, and this emblem was brought in time to the
present State House and hung on the wall, and it has
always been an object of interest to visitors, not only
as emblematic of sundry fishery problems that perplex
the statesmen, but also as recalling a question
always of lively interest in New England and elsewhere,
"Does the codfish salt the ocean, or the
ocean salt the codfish?" Another great treasure is
held by the State Library, which has a hundred
thousand volumes; and the chief of its possessions,
exhibited under glass, is the "History of the Plimouth
Plantation," popularly known as the "Log of
the 'Mayflower,'" written by Governor William
Bradford. This manuscript, discovered in London
in 1846, was presented to Massachusetts in 1898.</p>

<p class="center p2">NOTABLE BOSTON ATTRACTIONS.</p>

<p>A ramble through the older parts of Boston discloses
many objects of interest. Near the northern edge
of the Common, at the corner of Park and Tremont
Streets, is the old "Brimstone Corner," where stands
the citadel of orthodoxy, the Puritan meeting-house,
Park Street Church. Adjoining is an ancient graveyard,
the "Old Granary Burying-Ground," where
lie the remains of some of the most famous men of
Boston, John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Paul Revere,
James Otis, Peter Faneuil, many of the colonial Governors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and also the parents of Benjamin Franklin, a
prominent monument marking the graves of the
latter. The rows of ancient, dark-looking and half-effaced
gravestones in this quiet burial-place, in
one of the busiest parts of the city, are an antique
novelty. Many noted buildings are near it&mdash;Tremont
Temple, the Horticultural and Music Halls, the
Athenæum, and not far away, fronting Pemberton
Square, the massive County Court-house of granite
in Renaissance style, four hundred and fifty feet
long, having in its imposing central hall a statue of
Rufus Choate. On Tremont Street was established
the first Episcopal Church in Boston, the King's
Chapel, the present building replacing the original
one in 1754. Adjacent is the oldest burying-place
of the colony, where lie the remains of Governor
John Winthrop and his sons, with other early settlers.
Most of the old gravestones in this yard have
been taken away from the graves and reset in strange
fashion as edge-stones along the paths. One of these
odd old stones of a greenish hue marked the grave
of William Paddy, dying in 1658. In an unique
poetical effusion it records these quaint words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Hear sleaps that blessed one</p>
<p>Whoes lief God help us all</p>
<p>To live that so when tiem shall be</p>
<p>That we this world must liue,</p>
<p>We ever may be happy</p>
<p>With blessed William Paddy."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Adjoining this old-time region is the splendid City
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Hall, grandly rising beyond the graveyard, in Italian
Renaissance, with an imposing louvre dome. In
front, upon School Street, are statues of Benjamin
Franklin and Josiah Quincy.</p>

<p>Various intricate streets and passages lead eastward
from Tremont Street into Washington Street,
these two chief business highways in a certain sense
being parallel. Washington Street is the main thoroughfare
of the city, having prominent theatres,
newspaper offices, many of the largest stores and
great office buildings, and it finally crosses over into
the South End, being a wider and straighter street
in this newer portion. Benjamin Franklin was born
in a little old dwelling near Washington Street, where
now stands a newspaper office. Alongside is the
"Old South Church," the most famous church of
Boston, but now an historical relic and museum of
Revolutionary antiquities, the congregation having
built themselves a magnificent temple, the "New Old
South Church," upon Boylston Street, in the fashionable
quarter of the Back Bay. This ancient church
is a curious edifice of colonial style, built in 1729,
when it replaced an earlier building. It has a tall
spire and a clock, to which it is said more eyes are
upturned than to any other dial in New England.
The interior is square, with double galleries on the
ends, and its original condition has been entirely restored.
It is brimful of history, and was the colonial
shrine of Boston, wherein were held the spirited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
meetings of the exciting days that hatched the Revolution.
Within it were arranged the preliminaries
leading to the march from its doors of the party of
disguised men who went down to the Liverpool wharf
and threw the tea overboard in December, 1773.
Behind the pulpit is the famous window through
which climbed Dr. Joseph Warren in 1775 to make
the oration on the anniversary of the "Boston
Massacre," that had so much to do with creating the
high condition of feeling producing the final defiance
of the British soldiery, culminating in the battle of
Lexington. The British afterwards turned the building
into a riding-school. Franklin was baptized in
the original church, and here Whitefield preached.
For nearly two centuries there was delivered, in this
noted church, the annual "election sermon" before
the Governor and Legislature. It was only by the
greatest exertions that the venerable building was
saved from the fire of 1872, which halted at its edge.
It now belongs to a patriotic society, who maintain it
as a precious historical relic.</p>

<p>Also fronting upon Washington Street is the "Old
State House," an oblong and unpretending building
at the head of State Street, dating from 1748, which
was the headquarters of the Massachusetts Provincial
Government. The "Boston Massacre," in March,
1770, originating in an encounter between a British
sentry and the crowd, resulting in the troops firing
upon the populace, occurred in the street on its eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
side. Afterwards Samuel Adams, voicing the
public indignation, made within the building, in an
address to the Executive Council, his memorable and
successful demand that the British soldiery should be
removed outside the city. It has been restored as
far as possible to its original condition, even the figures
of the British "Lion and Unicorn," which had
been taken down in Revolutionary days, having been
replaced on the wings of the roof over the southern
front. The upper rooms contain a valuable collection
of relics and paintings, and much that is of interest
in connection with early Boston history. Opposite
are the tall Ames and Sears Buildings of modern
construction, while State Street extends northeast
through the financial district to the harbor, passing
the massive granite dome-surmounted Custom House.</p>

<p>Dock Square is not far away, and Change Alley
and other intricate passages lead over to the Boston
"Cradle of Liberty," Faneuil Hall. Old Peter Faneuil,
a Huguenot merchant, built it for a market and
presented it to the city in 1742, but it was unfortunately
burnt, being rebuilt in 1761. Within it were
held the early town-meetings, and it is still the great
place for popular assemblages. It was enlarged to
its present size in 1805. This famous Hall is a plain
rectangular building, seventy-six feet square inside,
the lower floor a market, and the upper portion an
assembly room. It is located, with surmounting
cupola, in an open square, and when anything excites
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the public it is crowded with standing audiences,
there being no seats. Across the end is a raised
platform for the orators, behind which, on the wall, is
Healy's large painting, representing the United States
Senate listening to a speech by Daniel Webster, his
noted oration in the South Carolina nullification days
of 1832, when Webster was the champion of the
Union. There are numerous historical portraits on
the walls. The "Ancient and Honorable Artillery
Company," dating from 1638, occupy the floor above
the Hall, while in front of it and extending towards
the harbor is the spacious Quincy Market.</p>

<p>At the corner of Washington and School Streets
is another ancient building, its quaint gambrels and
gables recalling primitive architecture&mdash;the "Old
Corner Book-store," long a favorite literary haunt.
Northward, Washington Street extends to Haymarket
Square, and beyond is Charlestown Street,
passing by Copp's Hill, now reduced in size. Upon
this hill is the oldest Boston church,&mdash;Christ Church
in Salem Street,&mdash;dating from 1723, from whose
steeple, on the eve of the battle of Lexington, in
April, 1775, were displayed the lights giving warning
of the movement of the British troops starting
from Boston for Concord. These signals notified
Paul Revere, across the Charles River, who made his
famous midnight ride that roused the country. The
silver-plate, service-books and Bible of the church
were gifts from King George II., and in the adjacent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
burial-ground are the graves of the three noted Doctors
Mather, who had so much to do with colonial
affairs and history&mdash;Increase, Cotton and Samuel&mdash;the
last dying in 1785. The great Boston fire of
1872, which ravaged the district east of Washington
Street for two days, extended over fifty acres, and destroyed
nearly eight hundred buildings. The section
was quickly rebuilt, however, with much finer structures,
and is now the chief wholesale business district
of Boston. The elaborate Government Building,
containing the Post-office and Courts, was erected,
since the fire, of Cape Ann granite, at a cost of $7,500,000.
In this district are enormous office-buildings,
insurance-offices, banks, extensive blocks of
stores, and the headquarters of the leading trades of
New England, the boot and shoe, cotton and woollen,
dry goods, paper and wool merchants, Boston being
the greatest wool mart in the country. When Boston,
having preserved Beacon Hill and reduced in
size Copp's Hill, decided to remove the third eminence
of the "Tri-mountain," Fort Hill, its earth
and rocks were used to give better commercial facilities
by filling in and grading the magnificent marginal
highway fronting the harbor, Atlantic Avenue.
In front of this broad street the wharves project
many hundreds of feet, having rows of capacious
storehouses in their centres, while on either side are
wide docks for the shipping. Here is conducted an
extensive traffic with all parts of the world, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
these wharves come the yacht-like fishing-smacks to
unload their catch of cod and mackerel, while there
are piles of fish in the stores. Thus is realized the
significance of the emblematic codfish hanging in the
State House.</p>

<p class="center p2">BOSTON DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>When the great Boston fire had been quenched,
and an estimate was being formed of the enormous
losses, the significant statement was made that "the
best treasure of Boston cannot be burnt up. Her
grand capital of culture and character, of science and
skill, humanity and religion, is beyond the reach of
flame. Sweep away every store and house, every
school and church, and let the people with their history
and habits remain, and they still have one of
the richest and strongest cities on earth." This is
the prominent characteristic of Boston public spirit.
The people take the greatest pride in their city, its
high rank and achievements, and the wealthy and
energetic townsfolk are always alert to extend them.
There are more libraries, schools, colleges, art and
scientific collections, museums, conservatories of
music and educational foundations in and near Boston
than in any other American city. Magnificent structures,
the homes of art, science and education, are
scattered with prodigality all about. Next to the
Library of Congress, the Boston Public Library is
the largest in America. Bostonians love the fine
arts, and the many open spaces and public grounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
are adorned with statues of eminent men and groups
representing historical events. The people seem to
be always studying and investigating, the women as
well as the men pursuing the difficult paths of abstruse
knowledge, so that armies of them, fully
equipped, scatter over the country to impart the
learning of the "Modern Athens" to less fortunate
communities. There are many fine churches, especially
in the newer parts of the West End, whither
have removed into grand temples of modern artistic
construction quite a number of the wealthy congregations
of the older town. Boston is also full of
clubs, in endless variety, formed for every conceivable
purpose, and several of them very handsomely
housed.</p>

<p>To get available room and facilitate business, the
city has gathered the terminals of all the railways
into two enormous stations on the northern and southern
sides of the town, and for nearly a half century
it has been filling-in the fens and lowlands to the
westward, so that now this reclaimed West End is
the fashionable section, containing the finest churches,
hotels, and residences. Through this splendid district
extends for over a mile the grand Commonwealth
Avenue, two hundred and forty feet wide, its centre
being a tree-embowered park adorned by statues of
Alexander Hamilton, John Glover, William Lloyd
Garrison, and Leif Ericson, and having on either
side a magnificent boulevard. The bordering residences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
are fronted by delicious gardens, and at regular
intervals fine streets cross at right angles, their
names arranged alphabetically, in proceeding westward,
with the well-known English titles, Arlington,
Berkeley, Clarendon, Dartmouth, Exeter, Fairfield,
Gloucester, Hereford, etc. Parallel to the Avenue
are also laid out Boylston, Marlborough, Newbury
and Beacon Streets through this favorite residential
section. Proceeding out Boylston Street are passed
the stately buildings of the Museum of Natural History,
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
with twelve hundred students, the leading institution
of its kind in America. Beyond, at the intersection
of Dartmouth Street, is Copley Square, displaying
around it the finest architectural group in the city,
five magnificent buildings, three of them churches.
Trinity Episcopal Church, built on the northern side,
in free Romanesque, is formed as a Latin cross, with
a massive central tower, two hundred and ten feet
high. It has elaborate interior decoration and fine
windows. The Public Library, on the southern side,
is in Roman Renaissance, two hundred and twenty-eight
by two hundred and twenty-five feet, and sixty-eight
feet high, erected at a cost of nearly $2,400,000.
It contains eight hundred thousand volumes,
and the interior is excellently adapted to its uses,
being tastefully adorned. The Second Unitarian
Church, on the northern side of the square, built in
1874, was the church of the three Mathers, and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Ralph Waldo Emerson. The Museum of Fine Arts,
on the eastern side of the square, is constructed of
red brick and terra-cotta, and contains extensive collections.
The fifth building fronting the square is
the "New Old South Church," in Italian Gothic, with
a tower rising two hundred and forty-eight feet.</p>

<p>Beyond this fashionable district, the "Back Bay
Fens" have been skillfully laid out in a series of
boulevards and parks, making a chain extending
several miles south and southwest through the suburbs,
Franklin Park, covering nearly a square mile,
being the chief. Here, on grounds with great natural
adornments, in Roxbury, Brookline, and Brighton,
is a region of much beauty. The surface is undulating,
finely wooded, dotted with lakes, and displaying
many costly suburban houses, in full glory of
garden and foliage. This pleasant region spreads to
Chestnut Hill, where the city has its great water reservoir,
holding eight hundred million gallons, the
favorite drive from Boston being to and around this
reservoir, the route giving splendid views from the
hilltop. Jamaica Pond and Jamaica Plain are near
by, two of Boston's attractive cemeteries being beyond
the latter, Mount Hope and Forest Hills. Here
is also the famous Arnold Arboretum, the greatest
institution of its kind, now part of the park system,
and having a grand outlook from its central hill. In
West Roxbury is the Martin Luther Orphan Home,
which now occupies the noted "Brook Farm," where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
a group of cultivated people, led by George Ripley,
and including Hawthorne, Curtis, Dana, Channing,
Thoreau, Emerson, and Margaret Fuller, made their
famous attempt to found a socialistic community in
1841, but found that it would not work. It was described
as an experiment in "plain living and high
thinking," the articles of association calling it the
"Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education,"
for the establishment of an "agricultural,
literary, and scientific school or college." Pupils
were taken, and in its most successful period there
were about one hundred and fifty persons in the
community; "kitchen and table were in common;
very little help was hired, but philosophers, clergymen
and poets worked at the humblest tasks, milking
cows, pitching manure, cleaning stables, etc.,
while cultivated women cooked, washed, ironed,
and waited at table; all work, manual or intellectual,
was credited to members at a uniform rate of ten cents
an hour." Later, it became a Fourieristic "phalanstery,"
under the title of the "Brook Farm Phalanx;"
then, in 1845, the chief building burnt down, and
financial difficulties following, the experiment, which
had excited world-wide comment, was abandoned in
1847.</p>

<p class="center p2">NONATUM AND SUDBURY.</p>

<p>To the westward of Brighton is the extensive and
wealthy suburban city of Newton, a favorite place of
rural residence for Bostonians. Here rises, near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Newton Corner, the ancient Nonatum Hill, where the
Apostle Eliot first preached to the Indians, the name
being now classically modernized into Mount Ida.
Eliot converted these Indians, who became the Christian
tribe of Nonatum and formed their system of
government after the plan set forth in the Book of
Exodus, with rulers of hundreds, of fifties, and of
tens. For them the Bible was translated into the
Indian language by Eliot and printed at Cambridge
in 1663. They removed nearer to Charles River,
where there were better soils, at Natick, their village
consisting of three streets lined with little huts and
gardens, a large circular fort, and a building for a
church and school, at the same time having a rude
bridge constructed over the river. Natick is now a
busy shoemaking town, with about ten thousand
people, and in South Natick is the old Indian cemetery
and Eliot's Oak. To the northward of Natick
is Cochituate Lake, the chief source of Boston's water
supply, over three miles long, and having with tributary
ponds nearly a thousand acres area when full of
water in the spring. To the eastward of Natick is
Wellesley, where the famous Wellesley Female College,
with seven hundred students, has its spacious
buildings located in a beautiful park. To the northward
is the valley of Sudbury River, into which Lake
Cochituate discharges, and here at Sudbury was the
old colonial tavern which Longfellow has given renown
in his "Tales of a Wayside Inn":

tales by the landlord, the student, the theologian, the
poet, the musician, and other sojourners, which have

American literature.</p>

<p class="center p2">CHARLESTOWN AND BUNKER HILL.</p>

<p>Across the Charles River, northward from the
Shawmut peninsula of Boston, is Charlestown, one
of the earliest settled suburbs, a large part of the
river front being occupied by the Navy Yard, which
covers a surface approximating a hundred acres.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Here were built many famous vessels of the older
navy, anterior to the change to steel construction,
and the first Government dry-dock in the country
was placed at this yard, which after the war of 1812
became one of the leading naval stations. Among
the historical features of the yard has been the famous
ship "Constitution," familiarly known as "Old Ironsides,"
which is again to be rebuilt for preservation.
This noted ship, with others that achieved renown in
the war of 1812, was kept at Charlestown, and all
of them having rotted, the Navy Department in
1830 decided to destroy them so as to save further
trouble, and an article announcing this appeared in a
Boston newspaper. Little did the naval authorities,
however, appreciate the sentimental love the country
had for the old "Constitution." Two days after the
newspaper announcement, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
then twenty-one years of age, published his poem of
"Old Ironsides," which caused such a sensation.</p>

<p>These stirring lines of earnest protest touched
the popular heart, there was an universal outburst
of indignation, and the "Constitution" was
saved. The old ship was rebuilt on her original lines,
only a few timbers, including the keel, being retained,
and the former allegorical figure-head was replaced
by one modelled in the image of Andrew Jackson,
then President of the United States. This change
was sanctioned by the Secretary of the Navy,
although Commodore Hull, who had charge of rebuilding
the ship, protested against it. The reconstructed
"Constitution" was launched in 1834, and
anchored, with her figure-head, but a short distance
from Charlestown bridge. Politics ran high at the
time, and the change caused great controversy, particularly
in and around Boston. One stormy night,
Captain Samuel W. Dewey, then a hardy young
sailor, managed without discovery to saw off Jackson's
head, and carried it away. When the mutilation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
was disclosed next day there was another great
clamor, and so intense was the excitement that the
utmost exertions were vainly made to find the man
who did the daring deed. Dewey kept his secret for
several weeks, but suddenly, under an unexplainable
impulse, decided he would go to Washington and
give the sawed-off head to President Jackson himself.
He appeared before the Secretary of the Navy,
and stating that he was the man who had removed
the figure-head from the "Constitution," said he had
brought it along to restore it, exhibiting the grim
features tied up in a bandana handkerchief. The
Secretary was indignant, and spoke of having him
arrested, but Dewey said there was no statute that
he had violated, and the Secretary, calming down
finally, listened to the man's story of how he took
away the head, and agreed to take it to President
Jackson. He took the mutilated head over to the
White House, exhibited it to Jackson, and repeated
to him Dewey's story. When Jackson had heard
the tale he burst out in loud laughter, and pointing
at the head, said: "That is the most infernal graven
image I ever saw. The fellow did perfectly right;
you've got him, you say; well, give him a kick and
my compliments, and tell him to saw it off again."
Captain Dewey was afterwards called the "figure-head
man," and was given a public dinner in Philadelphia
on his return from Washington. He died at
an advanced age, in 1899.

<p>The crowning glory of Charlestown is the Bunker
Hill Monument, marking the greatest historical event
of Boston, the famous battle fought June 17, 1775,
when the British stormed the Yankee redoubt on the
hilltop north of Charles River, which was then open
country, but long ago became surrounded by the
buildings of the expanding city, excepting the small
space of the battlefield, now reserved for a park
around the monument. The granite shaft rises two
hundred and twenty-one feet, upon the highest part
of the eminence. The Provincial troops had assembled
in large numbers north and west of Boston,
mainly in Cambridge to the westward, and hearing
that the British intended to occupy Bunker and
Breed's Hills, in Charlestown, a force was sent under
Colonel William Prescott, a veteran of the old French
war, in the night, to fortify Bunker Hill. Upon
crossing over, they hastily decided that it was better
to occupy Breed's Hill, which, while part of the same
ridge, was nearer Boston, and they constructed upon
it a square redoubt. The British ships in Charles
River discovered this at daylight, and began a cannonade;
American reinforcements were sent from
Cambridge; and in the afternoon General Gage attacked,
his onslaught being three times repulsed with
heavy slaughter, when, the Americans' ammunition
being spent, they could only resist with clubbed muskets
and stones, and had to retreat. Facing Boston,
in front of the monument, the direction from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the attack came, is the bronze statue of Prescott, the
broad-brimmed hat shading his earnest face, as, with
deprecatory yet determined gesture, he uttered the
memorable words of warning that resulted in such
terrible punishment of the British storming column:
"Don't fire until I tell you; don't fire until you see
the whites of their eyes." The traces of the hastily
constructed breastworks of the redoubt can be seen
on the brow of the hill, and a stone shows where Dr.
Joseph Warren fell, he being killed in the battle.
He came to the fight as a volunteer, and had been
made a General in the Provincial army. The top of
the tall monument gives a splendid view in all directions
over the harbor and suburbs of Boston, with
traces of Mount Wachusett far to the westward, and
on clear days a dim outline of the distant White
Mountains. The corner-stone of the monument was
laid by Lafayette on his American visit in 1825, and
it was completed and dedicated in 1842, the oration
on both occasions being delivered by Daniel Webster.
One of his glowing passages thus tells the purpose
of the monument:</p>

<p>"We come as Americans to mark a spot which
must forever be dear to us and to our posterity. We
wish that whosoever, in all coming time, shall turn
his eye hither, may behold that the place is not undistinguished
where the first great battle of the Revolution
was fought. We wish that this structure
may proclaim the magnitude and importance of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
event to every class and every age. We wish that
infancy may learn the purpose of its erection from
eternal lips, and that weary and withered age may
behold it and be solaced by the recollections which
it suggests. We wish that labor may look up here
and be proud in the midst of its toil. We wish that
in those days of disaster which, as they come upon
all nations, must be expected to come upon us also,
desponding patriotism may turn its eyes hitherward,
and be assured that the foundations of our national
powers are still strong."</p>

<p class="center p2">CAMBRIDGE AND HARVARD.</p>

<p>Various long causeways over the wide expanse of
Charles River where it spreads out to form the Back
Bay, and passing in front of the newly filled-in West
End, lead from Boston to the academic city of Cambridge.
This populous city, best known from Harvard
University, is beautifully situated on a plain, has
important manufacturing industries, handsome public
buildings, and a large number of elegant private residences
in spacious grounds ornamented with fine old
trees, shrubbery and flower-gardens. Cambridge was
settled soon after Boston, as the "Newe Towne," in
1630. Its Common contains the venerable "Washington
Elm," over three hundred years old, under
which, after the battle of Bunker Hill, General Washington
assumed command, July 3, 1775, of the American
army besieging Boston. Opposite the southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
end of the Common are old Christ Church, built of
materials sent out from England, and the First Parish
Church, with a Gothic steeple, having between them
the burying-ground of the old town. Of these,
Oliver Wendell Holmes has written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Like Sentinel and Nun they keep</p>
<p class="i1">Their vigil on the green;</p>
<p>One seems to guard and one to weep</p>
<p class="i1">The dead that lie between."</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the suburbs of Cambridge, adjoining Charles
River, is Boston's chief place of interment, Mount
Auburn Cemetery, a romantic enclosure of hill and
vale, covering one hundred and twenty-five acres,
with a grand development of tombs and landscape.
The tower upon the summit of the Mount gives a
beautiful outlook over the winding Charles River
valley and the Brookline, Brighton and West Roxbury
villa and park districts beyond, the distant view
being closed by the charming Blue Hills of Milton.
In this cemetery are interred many of the famous
men of Massachusetts, including Longfellow, Lowell,
Holmes, Everett, Sumner, Motley, Choate, Quincy,
Agassiz and Prescott.</p>

<p>The great Cambridge institution, however, is Harvard
University, the oldest, largest and wealthiest
seat of learning in America. In 1636 the Massachusetts
Legislature founded a school at the "Newe
Towne," voting £400 for the purpose, and in 1638
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
John Harvard, who had been for a short time a
pastor in Charlestown, died at the age of thirty-one,
and left to this school his library of two hundred and
sixty volumes and half his estate, valued at about
£800. Then the school was made a college and
named Harvard, and the town was called Cambridge
by the Legislature. The monument of the youthful
patron is in Charlestown, and, cast in heroic bronze,
he now sits in a capacious chair in front of the Harvard
Memorial Hall. This great University far antedates
its rival Yale at New Haven, for its first
class was graduated in 1642, and in 1650 "The
President and Fellows of Harvard College" were incorporated.
In fact, Harvard was founded only
ninety years later than the great College of English
Cambridge&mdash;Emmanuel. John Harvard and Henry
Dunster, who was the first President of Harvard,
and several other prominent Boston colonists, had
been students at Emmanuel, and thus from the older
Puritan foundation came the younger, and it was natural
to adopt for the town the name of the English
University city. The first New England printing-press
was set up in 1639 at Cambridge, and in the
Riverside Press and the University Press of to-day
it is succeeded by two renowned book-making establishments.
Closely allied, in a scientific way, has
also been at Cambridgeport for many years the
works of Alvan Clark &amp; Co., the noted makers of
telescope lenses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>Harvard University has sent out many thousands
of famous graduates, and Longfellow, Holmes and
Lowell have been members of its faculty. It is liberally
endowed, has ample grounds, and there are over
sixty buildings devoted to the purposes of the University,
the annual disbursements exceeding $1,000,000.
Its government was formerly a strictly religious
organization, most of the graduates becoming clergymen,
but it was recently secularized so that no
denominational religion is now insisted upon, and
comparatively few graduates enter the pulpit. There
are schools of law, medicine, dentistry, divinity, agriculture,
the arts and sciences, all the learned professions
being provided for, but everything is elective.
In the various departments there are more than four
thousand students, taught by about four hundred
professors and instructors. It has some seven hundred
acres of land, interest-bearing endowments exceeding
$8,000,000, receives, besides, annual gifts
sometimes reaching $400,000, and has a library of
five hundred thousand volumes and almost as many
pamphlets. Much attention is given outdoor sports
and athletic training, Harvard having the finest
gymnasium in the country, and an athletic field of
twenty acres south of the river. Among the graduates
have been two Presidents, John Adams and his
son John Quincy Adams; also his grandson, Charles
Francis Adams, William Ellery Channing, Edward
Everett, George Bancroft, Jared Sparks, William H.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Prescott, Emerson, Holmes, Sumner, Lowell, Motley
and Thoreau.</p>

<p>The University buildings are in the centre of the
old city, enclosing two large quadrangles shaded by
elms. Massachusetts Hall, the oldest building now
standing, dates from 1720, Harvard Hall from 1766,
and University Hall from 1815. The most elaborate
modern building is the Memorial Hall, a splendid
structure of brick and Nova Scotia stone, three hundred
and ten feet long, having a cloister at one end
and a massive tower at the other. This was erected
in memory of the Harvard graduates who fell in the
Civil War; and in the grand Vestibule which crosses
the building like a transept, having a marble floor
and rich vaulted ceiling of ash, and fine windows
through which pours a mellowed light, there are
tablets set in the arcaded sides bearing the names of
the dead. Upon one side of this impressive Vestibule
is the spacious Saunders Theatre, used for the
commencements and public services, having as an
adornment the statue of Josiah Quincy, a President
of the College and long the Mayor of Boston. Upon
the other side of the Vestibule is the college Great
Hall, one hundred and sixty-four feet long and eighty
feet high, with a splendid roof of open timber-work
and magnificent windows. This is the refectory
where a thousand students can dine, and in it centre
the most hallowed memories of Harvard, portraits
and busts of the distinguished graduates and benefactors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
adorning it, with the great western window
in the afternoon throwing a flood of rich sunlight over
the scene. Harvard has been patterned much after
the original Cambridge, thus adding to the English
vogue of many things seen about Boston. When
Charles Dilke visited America he wrote of Harvard,
"Our English Universities have not about them the
classic repose, the air of study, which belongs to
Cambridge, Massachusetts; our Cambridge comes
nearest to her daughter-town, but even the English
Cambridge has a breathing street or two, and a
weekly market-day, while Cambridge in New England
is one great academic grove, buried in a philosophic
calm, which our universities cannot rival as
long as men resort to them for other purposes than
work." The people at Boston told Dilke, when he
was here, that they spoke "the English of Elizabeth,"
and they heartily congratulated him at the same time
upon using what they said was "very good English
for an Englishman."</p>

<p>Adjoining Cambridge Common is Radcliffe College,
for women, named in honor of the English Lady Anne
Radcliffe, afterwards Lady Moulson, the first woman
giving a scholarship to Harvard (in 1640). Some
four hundred women receive instruction here from
Harvard professors, and the graduates are granted
the college degrees. Near by, in Brattle Street, is
the Craigie House, dating from 1759, which was
Washington's headquarters in 1775-6, and later, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
nearly a half century, was the home of Henry W.
Longfellow, until he died in 1882. Longfellow was
for twenty years Professor of Modern Languages in
Harvard, being succeeded in 1854 by James Russell
Lowell, whose home of Elmwood, an old colonial
house, is farther out Brattle Street. Lowell was born
in Cambridge in 1819, dying in 1891. Oliver Wendell
Holmes was born in Cambridge in 1809, and
being a skillful physician as well as a <i>litterateur</i>, he
was Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Harvard
from 1847 till 1882. He resided in Boston on
Beacon Street, dying in 1894. Margaret Fuller,
the noted transcendentalist, was born in Cambridge
in 1810, and after writing several books, and achieving
fame as a linguist and conversationalist, she went
abroad, marrying the Marquis d'Ossoli in Rome, and
returning to New York, they were both lost by shipwreck
at Fire Island in 1850.</p>

<p class="center p2">LEXINGTON AND CONCORD.</p>

<p>Following up the Charles River, about ten miles
west of Boston is Waltham, with twenty-two thousand
people, noted for the works of the American
Waltham Watch Company, the largest in the world,
producing nearly six hundred thousand watches and
movements in a year. The extensive factory buildings
spread along the river, and there are also large
cotton mills. General Nathaniel P. Banks was a
native of Waltham. To the northward and about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
twelve miles from Boston is the quiet village of Lexington,
chiefly built on one long tree-shaded street,
which terminates at its western end in a broad Green
of about two acres, whereon a plain monument recalls
the eight Revolutionary patriots killed there April
19, 1775. A handsome Memorial Hall of brick is
built on the Green to commemorate the Lexington
soldiers who fell in the Civil War. It also contains
statues of John Hancock and Samuel Adams, and
of the "Minute Man of 1775" and the "Volunteer
of 1861."</p>

<p>The British commander in Boston, having learnt
that the Massachusetts patriots had collected arms and
military stores at Concord, about twenty miles northwest
of Boston, on the night of April 18, 1775, despatched
a force to destroy them, and incidentally to
capture Hancock and Adams, who were at Lexington.
The roads leading westward out of Boston were picketed
to prevent news being carried of the expedition,
but the signals from the old Christ Church on Copp's
Hill enabled Paul Revere to start from Charlestown
through Cambridge, and he made his rapid horseback
ride, arriving by midnight at Lexington. The bells
of the village churches rang out the alarm, signal-guns
were fired, and messengers were sent in every
direction to arouse the people. About five o'clock in
the morning Major Pitcairn with six British companies
arrived at Lexington, where the patriots, numbering
about seventy, were drawn up in line on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Green. Pitcairn rode forward and shouted "Disperse,
ye rebels; throw down your arms and disperse!"
They held their ground, and a volley was fired over
their heads, when, not dispersing, a second volley was
fired, killing eight and wounding ten men, the first
blood shed in the American Revolution. The American
commander, seeing resistance was useless, withdrew
and dispersed his little band, some, as they retired,
discharging their muskets at the British, three
of the latter being wounded and Pitcairn's horse struck.
Then the British made a rapid movement to Concord,
and some of the military stores which had not been removed
were found and destroyed. Meanwhile about
four hundred Minute Men gathered near the North
Bridge over Concord River, about a mile from the
Common, and under orders they attacked and drove
away the British infantry, who had been placed on
guard there. As the morning advanced, the whole
country became aroused, and armed patriots assembled
from every direction, those of Lexington having
rallied and placed themselves along the Concord road.
The British commander was greatly alarmed and ordered
a retreat. They marched back to Boston under
a rattling fire, every house, barn and stone wall being
picketed by patriot sharpshooters, so that the road
was strewn with dead and dying British. Passing
through Lexington, the British met reinforcements,
but they were still pursued to Cambridge and Charlestown,
the slaughter only ceasing when they had got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
under protection of the guns of the fleet. The British
loss was about two hundred and seventy, and
the Americans lost one hundred. In Concord the
British graves and the battle monuments are on one
side of the historic bridge, and on the other is a fine
bronze statue of the "Minute Man." This Concord
fight was the first organized attack made by the
Americans upon the British in the Revolution, thus
beginning the patriot rebellion against British rule,
as the Minute Men were acting under authority of
the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts, assembled
in Concord, and protecting their military stores.</p>

<p>Concord has about six thousand people, and is
also famous for its literary history and associations.
It is near the tranquil Concord River and the junction
of the little Assabet and Sudbury Rivers, a pleasant
tree-embowered quiet place of rural residence. Peter
Bulkley, an English rector, who was oppressed by
Archbishop Laud, fled to New England, and in 1636
buying of the Indians their domain of Musketaquid,
founded the town and church of Concord, thus naming
it because of its peaceful acquisition. In the nineteenth
century it became noted as the home of some
of the greatest men of letters in America. Near
Concord bridge is an ancient gambrel-roofed house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
built for Parson William Emerson in 1765, and from
its windows he watched the fight. This is the "Old
Manse" in which Ralph Waldo Emerson, himself
once a clergyman, and descended from seven generations
of clergymen, was born in 1803. Emerson
was known as the "Sage of Concord," or, as Fredrika
Bremer the novelist, who visited him there, described
him, the "Sphinx in Concord," and was the
head of the modern school of transcendental philosophy.
He died in 1882. Nathaniel Hawthorne
lived for awhile in the "Old Manse" at Concord, and
there wrote his "Mosses from an Old Manse." The
house was afterwards burnt. Hawthorne died in
1864. Both Emerson and Hawthorne are buried in
the attractive little Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Emerson's
grave being marked by a large block of pink
quartz. Henry D. Thoreau, the eccentric but profound
scholar and naturalist, in 1845 built himself a
hut on the shores of the sequestered Walden Pond
near Concord, leading the life of a recluse, raising a
few vegetables, and now and then, to get a little
money, doing some work as carpenter or surveyor.
He was profoundly skilled in Oriental and classic literature,
and was an ardent naturalist, delighting in
making long pedestrian excursions to the forests,
lakes and ocean shores of New England. He never
voted, nor paid a tax, nor entered a church for worship,
and of himself he said, "I am as unfit for any
practical purpose as gossamer is for ship-timber."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Emerson tells us that "Thoreau dedicated his genius
with such entire love to the fields, hills and waters of
his native town, that he made them known and interesting
to all; he grew to be revered and admired
by his townsmen, who had at first known him only
as an oddity." Dying in 1862, he, too, is buried in
Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. In the Orchard House in
Concord lived the Alcotts, of whom Louisa M. Alcott,
author of <i>Little Women</i>, is so widely known.
Adjacent is the building used by the "Concord
School of Philosophy," established in 1879 by A.
Bronson Alcott. They also rest in the little Cemetery.
Thus is Concord famed, and it has well been
said of this historic old place that "it is dangerous
to turn a corner suddenly for fear of running over
some first-class saint, philosopher or sage."</p>

<p class="center p2">THE MASSACHUSETTS NORTH SHORE.</p>

<p>The outer verge of Boston Harbor may be described
as protected on the south by the long projection
of Nantasket Beach, while on the northern side
there comes out, as if to meet it, another curiously-formed
peninsula, making the bluffs of Winthrop,
and a strip beyond terminating in the rounded headland
of Point Shirley. Deer Island, almost connected
with the Point, stretches farther, and we were
anciently told it was so called "because of the deare
who often swim thither from the maine when they
are chased by the wolves." All these places are popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
resorts, and their odd formations assist in making
the Boston surroundings picturesque. Some distance
up the coast, and eleven miles from Boston, is the
shoemaking city of Lynn, with seventy thousand
people, the flourishing society of the "Knights of
St. Crispin" ruling the shoemakers' "teams" and
largely running the politics of the town. Most of
the work is done by machinery, there being over two
hundred factories, making more women's shoes than
any other place in the country. The first colonists
were brought by their pastor from Lynn-Regis,
England, in 1629, and thus the town was
named. It spreads broadly along the water-front,
its attractive City Hall seen from afar, and many
ornamental villas adorning the shore. Out beyond
it, thrust into the sea, is the long, low and narrow
sand-strip barely a hundred yards wide, leading for
nearly four miles to Nahant. This is a most curious
formation, the name meaning the "Lovers' Walk,"
a mass of rocks and soil at the outer end of the
sand-strip covering nearly five hundred acres, and
crowned with villas, the neat tower of a pretty white
church rising on the highest part near the centre.
The Bostonians have made Nahant, thus surrounded
by the ocean, one of their most fashionable suburban
sections, and it is popularly known as "Cold Roast
Boston." This strange rocky promontory was originally
bought from the Sagamore Poquanum for a
suit of clothes, and it is now valued at over $10,000,000.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Many are the poems written about this
curious projection, and N. P. Willis says of it: "If
you can imagine a buried Titan lying along the
length of a continent, with one arm stretched out
into the midst of the sea, the spot to which I would
transport you, reader mine, would be, as it were, in
the palm of the giant's hand." Invocations have
been addressed to Nahant by Longfellow, Whittier
and Mrs. Sigourney; there Longfellow wrote part
of <i>Hiawatha</i>, Motley began his <i>Dutch Republic</i>, Prescott
wrote his Spanish histories, and Agassiz composed
<i>Brazil</i>.</p>

<p>The region beyond Lynn and Nahant is the famous
Massachusetts "North Shore," stretching to the extremity
of Cape Ann, a domain of villas and summer
homes, pleasant sea-beaches, and brisk towns with
interesting past history, now devoted largely to shoemaking
and the fisheries. From Boston State House
to the extremity of the Cape at Halibut Point, or the
Land's End, is thirty-one miles, and Lucy Larcom
thus attractively describes the route along the shore:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"You may ride in an hour or two, if you will,</p>
<p>From Halibut Point to Beacon Hill,</p>
<p>With the sea beside you all the way,</p>
<p>Through pleasant places that skirt the bay;</p>
<p>By Gloucester harbor and Beverley beach,</p>
<p>Salem's old steeples, Nahant's long reach,</p>
<p>Blue-bordered Swampscott, and Chelsea's wide</p>
<p>Marshes laid bare to the drenching tide,</p>
<p>With a glimpse of Saugus' spire in the west,</p>
<p>And Malden Hills in their dreamy rest."</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>Saugus, Lynn, Nahant, Swampscott, Salem and
Marblehead were originally the Indian domains of
Saugus, Naumkeag and Massabequash. Beyond
Lynn, most of the coast has undergone a modern
evolution from fishery stations to smart summer resorts;
and here, around the swamps and marshes,
abounding crags protrude, with many fine villas in
another fashionable Boston suburb, Swampscott, as
populous and almost as famous as Nahant, with huge
hotels down by the seaside. Swampscott merges
into Clifton, and then an uneven backbone of
granite covering about six square miles is thrust
into the ocean in the direction of Cape Ann, and is
hedged about with rocky islets. On one side this
granite peninsula forms Salem harbor, while on the
other a miniature haven is made by a craggy appendage
to the southeastward, attached to the main
peninsula by a ligature of sand and shingle. The
quaint old town of Marblehead occupies most of the
surface, and the appendage is the modern yachtsmen's
headquarters, Marblehead Neck. This is a
very ancient place, dating back to the early seventeenth
century, and was once pre-eminently nautical
and the second port in Massachusetts; but the sailors
and fishermen are missing, excepting those who man
the summer yacht fleets, and the people, like so
many other Massachusetts communities, have gone
largely into shoemaking, the big shoe-factories being
scattered about. The crooked narrow streets run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
in all directions among and over the rocks, which
appear everywhere and have gained the mastery.
When George Whitefield, the preacher, visited Marblehead,
he gazed in astonishment upon these superabundant
rocks, and asked, in surprise, "Where do
they bury their dead?" Out on the headland is the
superannuated little Fort Sewall, once protecting the
port and commanding both harbors, and though the
walls are decaying, it is preserved as a memento of
the past. Fine villas are all about, and the numerous
islands add picturesqueness to the sea-view.
Elbridge Gerry, of "Gerrymander" fame, was a
native of Marblehead, and its hardy sailors formed
most of the crew of the old ship "Constitution"
when she fought and captured the "Guerriere," and
afterwards the "Cyane" and "Levant." Marblehead
was also the scene of "Skipper Ireson's Ride,"
which Whittier has made historic:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,</p>
<p>Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart</p>
<p class="i1">By the women of Marblehead!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>He had refused to take some of his townsmen off a
drifting wreck, because it would cost too much to
feed them on the way home.</p>

<p class="center p2">SALEM AND THE WITCHES.</p>

<p>Westward of the Marblehead peninsula, there
stretches into the mainland another noted haven of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the olden time, Salem harbor, dividing it into two
arms, the North and South Rivers, having between
them the town, chiefly built upon a peninsula about
two miles long. This was the Indian domain of
Naumkeag, a name preserved in many titles there,
and meaning the "Eel-Land." It was the mother-colony
on Massachusetts Bay, the first house being
built in 1626, and old John Endicott having got a
grant from Plymouth for the colony, he came out and
founded the town two years afterwards, calling it
Salem, "from the peace which they had and hoped
in it." But despite this peacefulness, the people
soon developed warlike tendencies. They scourged
Philip Ratcliffe, and cut off his ears and banished him
soon after the founding, for "blasphemy against the
First Church," and when the port had got well under
way, an annual trade statement showed imports of
$110,000 in arms and cannon, against $90,000 in
everything else. The "First Church," formed in
1629, was the earliest church organization in New
England, and it still exists. There were then ten
houses in the town, besides the Governor's house,
which the early history describes as "garnished with
great ordnance;" adding, "thus we doubt not that
God will be with us, and if God be with us, who can
be against us?" John Winthrop was here as Governor,
briefly, in 1630, soon migrating to Shawmut,
to found Boston for the capital of the colony. After
the Revolution, Salem was the leading seaport of New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
England; but its glory has departed, and the trade
has gone to Boston. In 1785 it sent out the first
American vessel that doubled the Cape of Good
Hope, and during a half century afterwards it held
almost a monopoly of the East India and China trade
with the United States, having at one time fifty-four
large ships thus engaged. The Salem ships also went
to the Southern seas, Japan and Africa. This trade
gave its people great wealth and influence, and it was
said, about 1810, that a Salem merchant was then
the largest shipowner in the world. But this has
retired into the dim past, and now it is a restful city
of about forty thousand people, its leading townsmen,
the descendants of the merchants and captains, living
in comfortable mansions surrounding the Common
and along the quiet elm-shaded streets in the residential
section. The rest of the population have
gone into shoemaking and other manufactures.</p>

<p>George Peabody, the philanthropist, was the most
noted citizen of Salem, born in the suburb of Danvers
(since changed to Peabody) in 1795, and, dying in
1869, his remains rest in Harmony Grove Cemetery.
In the Peabody Institute, which he founded in Danvers,
is kept as a sacred relic Queen Victoria's portrait,
her gift to him in recognition of his benefactions.
General Putnam, Nathaniel Bowditch, William
H. Prescott, the historian, W. W. Story, the sculptor,
and Nathaniel Hawthorne, were natives of Salem.
The East India Marine Hall is its most noted institution,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
a fine building filled with a remarkable Oriental
collection, gathered in the many voyages made by
Salem ships, and also having a valuable Natural
History Museum, designed to show the development
of animal life. In the Essex Institute are interesting
historical paintings and relics, including the charter
given by King Charles I. to the colony of Massachusetts
Bay. Also, carefully kept near by, is the original
"First Church," built in 1634 for the organization
formed in 1629, and of which Roger Williams
was the pastor before the Puritans banished him from
the colony. When the enlarging congregation built
a more spacious church, this quaint little house, with
its high-pointed roof, diamond-paned windows and
gallery, which is revered as the shrine of Salem, was
removed to its present location. In Essex Street is
also the old "Roger Williams House," a low-roofed
structure with a little shop in front, his home for a
brief period in 1635-36. This house has acquired
additional fame as a relic of the witchcraft days, for
in it was held the court trying some of the witches in
1692, who were afterwards taken to the gallows or
Witch Hill, on the western verge of the town, to be
put to death. The witchcraft delusion began in the
Danvers suburb and soon overran most of New England,
the prosecutions continuing more than a year.
Nineteen proven witches were executed, while one,
under the ancient English law, was pressed to death
for standing mute when told to plead. Old Cotton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Mather, the historian and pastor, was a leader in the
movement against the witches.</p>

<p>The North Shore, beyond Salem Harbor, stretches
far along the rock-bound coast of Cape Ann. Here
all the old fishing towns have become modern villa-studded
summer resorts, picturesque and attractive
in their newer development. Beverley, Manchester-by-the-Sea
and Magnolia all have grand headlands
and fine beaches. Beverley also has shoe-factories,
and is proud of the memory of Nathan Dane, the eminent
jurist, who named Dane Hall, the Harvard Law
School. Manchester has the "Singing Beach," where
the white sand, when stirred, emits a musical sound.
Magnolia, on a rocky bluff, is adjoined by the attractive
Crescent Beach, and has around it very fine
woodland. To the eastward is Rafe's Chasm, sixty
feet deep and only a few feet wide, and off shore,
almost opposite, is the bleak reef of Norman's Woe.
Inland is Wenham Lake, near Beverley, noted for its
ice supply, upon which all these places depend, while
beyond, the Ipswich River comes down through the
pleasant town of Ipswich, covering both banks with
houses, and flowing into Ipswich Bay north of the
peninsula of Cape Ann. To the westward is Andover,
where the thrifty Puritan Fathers, having bought the
domain from the Indians "for twenty-six dollars and
sixty-four cents and a coat," established the noted
Andover Theological Seminary of the Congregational
Church, where its ablest divines have been taught in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
what has been called "the school of the prophets."
Here, on "Andover Hill," abstruse theology has been
the ruling influence and intense religious controversies
have been waged, over three thousand clergymen
having been graduated. Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe
lived here after publishing <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, and is
buried here. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps was born here,
and wrote <i>Gates Ajar</i> in the venerable "Phelps
House." The Seminary buildings, the local guidebook
tells us, cause visitors to wonder "if orthodox
angels have not lifted up old Harvard and Massachusetts
Halls and carried them by night from Cambridge
to Andover Hill." Ipswich, too, has a famous Seminary,
but it is for the opposite sex. We are told that
one reason for the popularity of Ipswich Female Seminary
is that its location tends to softening the rigors
of study, as this is the place "where Andover theological
students are wont to take unto themselves
wives of the daughters of the Puritans." The indented
shore of Ipswich Bay was ancient Agawam,
of which Captain John Smith, coasting along in 1614,
recorded in his narrative that he saw "the many
cornfields and delightful groves of Agawam." The
fertile valley of Ipswich River is a veritable oasis
among the rocks, moors and salt-marshes that environ
it.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE MERRIMACK RIVER.</p>

<p>Near the northern boundary of Massachusetts is
the famous Merrimack River, flowing northeastward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
into the Atlantic, and noted for the enormous water-powers
it provides for the various mill-towns that
line its banks. It is a vigorous stream, having frequent
waterfalls and carrying a powerful current,
the name appropriately meaning "the swift water."
Oliver Wendell Holmes writes of it in <i>The School
Boy</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Do pilgrims find their way to Indian Ridge,</p>
<p>Or journey onward to the far-off bridge,</p>
<p>And bring to younger ears the story back</p>
<p>Of the broad stream, the mighty Merrimack?"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Merrimack drains the southern slopes of the
White Mountains, and takes the outflow of Lake
Winnipesaukee, a vast reservoir, the waters being
regulated at its outlet to suit the wants of the mills
below. It flows southward through New Hampshire
into Massachusetts, turning northeast to the ocean.
The river passes near Salisbury, where Daniel Webster
was born in 1782; then, seventy-five miles northwest
of Boston, comes to Concord, the capital of
New Hampshire, which has a fine Capitol building
and quarries of excellent granite; and eighteen miles
below, it reaches Manchester, the chief city of New
Hampshire, having sixty thousand people and many
large mills owned by wealthy corporations. Here
are the Amoskeag Falls (the Indian name meaning
the "fishing-place"), the largest on the Merrimack,
having fifty-five feet descent, and their water-power
being utilized through two canals. The chief products
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
are textile goods, locomotives and steam fire-engines.
Eighteen miles farther southward the
Nashua River comes up from the southwest, having
passed the industrial town of Fitchburg on the way,
and here at its confluence with the Merrimack is
Nashua, another busy factory town. At Amherst,
not far away, Horace Greeley was born in 1811.
Crossing the boundary into Massachusetts, the river
comes to the Pawtucket Falls, having thirty-two feet
descent, and furnishing the water-power, twenty-six
miles northwest of Boston, for the great mills of
Lowell, the third city of Massachusetts, having a hundred
thousand people, and spreading along the Merrimack
at its confluence with Concord River, coming
up from Concord Bridge of Revolutionary fame. The
first mill was built at Lowell in 1823, and its industries
have assumed a wide range and enormous output,
though the operatives are nearly all French
Canadians, and the language heard in this once
Yankee mill-town is now mainly French. The Merrimack,
having turned northeast, next comes to Lawrence,
where it descends rapids of twenty-eight feet
in the course of a half-mile. Here the Lawrence
family, of which the noted Abbott Lawrence was the
chief, established a town of cotton and woollen mills,
utilizing the rapids by constructing a huge dam nine
hundred feet long and thirty feet high, in 1845, at a
cost of $250,000. Here are the great Pacific Mills,
among the largest textile works in the world, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
city has over sixty thousand inhabitants. Nine miles
farther down the river is Haverhill, another manufacturing
town, with forty thousand people, largely
engaged in shoemaking. The poet John G. Whittier
was born in 1807 near Lake Kenoza, the scene of
his <i>Snowbound</i>, on the northeastern verge of Haverhill.</p>

<p>Below Haverhill the Merrimack is a navigable,
tidal stream, broadening into a spacious harbor at its
mouth in the town of Newbury, where the "ancient
sea-blown city" of Newburyport is built on the
southern shore, while five miles to the westward, on
the Pow-wow River, is Amesbury, long the home of
Whittier, who died in 1892, after having celebrated
this whole region in his poems. His house is maintained
as a memorial. Newburyport long since
turned its attention from commerce to making shoes
and other manufactures, and it now has about eighteen
thousand population. Its splendid High Street,
upon the crest of the ridge, one of the noted tree-embowered
highways of New England, stretches several
miles parallel to the river, down towards the
sea, bordered by the stately mansions of the olden
time. The Merrimack sweeps grandly along in front
of them with a broad curve to the ocean, three miles
below. The Newburyport Marine Museum contains
foreign curiosities brought home by the old-time sea
captains, and the Public Library, endowed by George
Peabody, occupies an impressive colonial mansion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
which has been flavored by the entertainment of
Generals Washington and Lafayette. The Old South
Presbyterian Church has the body of the famous
preacher George Whitefield, who died in Newburyport
in 1770, interred in a vault under the pulpit.
In a little wooden house behind this church, William
Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist, was born in 1805.
Caleb Cushing the jurist and John B. Gough the
temperance lecturer lived in Newburyport; but its
resident who probably achieved the greatest notoriety
in his day was "Lord" Timothy Dexter, an
eccentric merchant of the eighteenth century, who
made a large fortune by singular ventures, among
them shipping a cargo of warming-pans to the West
Indies, where they were sold to the planters at a stiff
profit for boiling sugar.</p>

<p>Whittier's home was on the Merrimack, and he
has written for the river a noble invocation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Stream of my fathers! sweetly still</p>
<p>The sunset rays thy valley fill;</p>
<p>Poured slantwise down the long defile,</p>
<p>Wave, wood, and spire beneath them smile.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Centuries ago, that harbor bar,</p>
<p>Stretching its length of foam afar,</p>
<p>And Salisbury's beach of shining sand,</p>
<p>And yonder island's wave-smoothed strand,</p>
<p>Saw the adventurer's tiny sail</p>
<p>Flit, stooping from the eastern gale;</p>
<p>And o'er these woods and waters broke</p>
<p>The cheer from Britain's hearts of oak,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>
<p>As, brightly on the voyager's eye,</p>
<p>Weary of forest, sea and sky,</p>
<p>Breaking the dull continuous wood,</p>
<p>The Merrimack rolled down his flood.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Home of my fathers! I have stood</p>
<p>Where Hudson rolled his lordly flood:</p>
<p>Seen sunrise rest and sunset fade</p>

<p>On Juniata's silver streak;</p>
<p>Have seen along his valley gleam</p>
<p>The Mohawk's softly winding stream;</p>
<p>The level light of sunset shine</p>
<p>Through broad Potomac's hem of pine;</p>
<p>And autumn's rainbow-tinted banner</p>
<p>Hang lightly o'er the Susquehanna;</p>
<p>Yet wheresoe'er his step might be,</p>
<p>Thy wandering child looked back to thee:</p>

<p>The unforgotten swell and roar</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="center p2">THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK.</p>

<p>It was in the valley of the Merrimack that Whittier
located the scene of his famous poem, the "Bridal
of Pennacook." This American epic tells&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"A story of the marriage of the chief</p>
<p>Of Saugus to the dusky Weetamoo,</p>
<p>Daughter of Passaconaway, who dwelt</p>
<p>In the old time upon the Merrimack."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Winnepurkit was the son of Nanapashemet, or the
New Moon, and was the Sagamore of Saugus, Naumkeag,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
and the adjoining domain. He was of noble
blood and valor, and for his bride chose the daughter
of Passaconaway, the great chief, ruling all the tribes
in the Merrimack Valley, who lived at Pennacook,
now Concord. Not only was Passaconaway a mighty
chief, but he was also the greatest Powah or wizard
of his time, the colonial annalists gravely telling that
he could make trees dance, waters burn, and green
leaves grow in winter, through his necromancy.
When Winnepurkit married this wizard's daughter,
great was the feasting at this "Bridal of Pennacook."
Then Passaconaway caused a select party of warriors
to escort his daughter to her husband's home at Saugus,
where they received princely entertainment.
Not long afterwards the bride expressed a wish to
again see her father and her home at Pennacook,
whereupon her husband sent her thither, escorted by
a trusty band, who were graciously received and rewarded.
After some time Weetamoo desired to
return to Saugus, and her father sent word of this to
his son-in-law by messengers, requesting that a suitable
guard be provided to escort her down. But
Winnepurkit liked not this method, and bade the
messengers return with this reply, "That when his
wife departed from him he caused his own men to
wait upon her to her father's territories, as did become
him; but now that she had an intent to return,
it did become her father to send her back with a convoy
of his own people, and that it stood not with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Winnepurkit's reputation either to make himself or
his men so servile as to fetch her again." This reply,
as may be imagined, ruffled the old chief, and he
sent a sharp answer "That his daughter's blood
and birth deserved more respect than to be slighted
in such a manner, and therefore, if Winnepurkit
would have her company, he were best to send or
come for her." Neither would yield the point of
Indian etiquette, and the colonial narrator leaves it
to be inferred that she then remained with her father,
though it is supposed she subsequently rejoined her
husband. The poet has made good use of the story,
illustrating the scenery of the region with great
felicity, but giving the tale a highly dramatic ending.
Whittier makes the heart-broken bride, in her effort
to return to her husband, launch her canoe upon the
swollen Merrimack above the falls at Amoskeag when
a spring freshet was bringing down masses of ice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Down the vexed centre of that rushing tide,</p>
<p>The thick, huge ice-blocks threatening either side,</p>
<p>The foam-white rocks of Amoskeag in view,</p>
<p>With arrowy swiftness sped that light canoe.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Sick and aweary of her lonely life,</p>
<p>Heedless of peril, the still faithful wife</p>
<p>Had left her mother's grave, her father's door,</p>
<p>To seek the wigwam of her chief once more!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Down the white rapids, like a sere leaf whirled,</p>
<p>On the sharp rocks and piled-up ices hurled,</p>
<p>Empty and broken, circled the canoe,</p>
<p>In the vexed pool below&mdash;but where was Weetamoo?"</p>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">CAPE ANN.</p>

<p>Out in front of the region we have been describing
projects the famous "ridge of rocks and roses,"
the gaunt headland of Cape Ann. This is a ponderous
mass of hornblende granite, advanced forward
twelve to fifteen miles into the ocean, with Thatcher's
Island beyond, on which are the twin lighthouses
that guard the mariner, forty-two miles north of the
Highland Light on Cape Cod. The granite hills of
the iron-bound headland are fringed with forests,
while jagged reefs and rocky islets surround it,
against which the sea beats in perpetual warfare.
The surface is strewn with boulders, many of large
size, and beds of the finest white sand are interspersed.
The Indians called this promontory Wingaersheek,
and when Captain John Smith came
along he named it Cape Tragabizonda, in memory
of a Moslem princess who had befriended him when
a prisoner in Constantinople, also calling three small
islands off the cape the "Three Turks' Heads."
But King Charles I. would have none of this, however,
and called the headland Cape Ann, after his
royal mother, and thus it has remained. The haven
on the southern side, Gloucester harbor, was early
sought as a fishing station, being known in 1624, and
it received its name in 1642, most of the early settlers
coming from Gloucester in England. Champlain
found it a safe harbor when in peril, and writes of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
as "Le Beau Port." In August, 1892, this famous
fishery port celebrated its two hundred and fiftieth
anniversary with great fervor.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig86" id="fig86"></a>
<img src="images/i101.jpg" width="550" height="377" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>Along the Shore, Cape Anne,
Gloucester, Mass.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The prosperity of Gloucester has come from the
fisheries, it being the greatest cod and mackerel port
in America, and having the most extensive fleet of
fishing-boats in the world, exceeding six hundred,
employing over six thousand men. The population
approximates thirty thousand, and it is said their
earnings on the fishery product are over $4,000,000
annually. The earliest form of the Cape Ann fishing-smack
was known as the "Chebacco," two-masted,
cat-rigged, and of ten or twelve tons, made sharp at
both ends, and getting the name from the first place
of building, Chebacco Parish, in Ipswich, adjoining
the Cape. From this was developed the popular
American build of vessel known as the schooner, the
first one being launched at Gloucester in 1713. After
sliding down the launching-ways, she so gracefully
glided out upon the water that a bystander exclaimed
in admiration, "See how she schoons!" and thus was
she unexpectedly named, for a "schooner" has that
style of vessel been ever since called. Gloucester
surrounds its spacious harbor as a broad crescent,
having Ten Pound Island in front sentinelling the
entrance to the inner haven, so named because that
was the price said to have been paid the Indians for
it. The deeply indented harbor opens towards the
southwest, being protected from the ocean by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
long peninsula of Eastern Point, having a fort and
lighthouse on its extremity. Some seventy wharves
jut out from the circular head of the bay, with granite
hills rising behind, up which the town is terraced.
Shipping of all kinds are scattered about, including
large salt-laden ships, while fishermen and sailors
wander through the streets and assemble around the
docks, spinning yarns and preparing for fishing ventures
out to the "Banks." The odd old town around
the harbor has seen little change for years, but the
newer portions are greatly improved, having many
imposing buildings, including a fine City Hall. The
numerous churches have gained for it the title of
"Many-spired Gloucester," and no place could disclose
more picturesque sea views.</p>

<p>But the fishery interest pervades the whole town,
dwarfing everything else. The main street winds
about the head of the harbor, bending with the sinuosities
of the shore, and from it other streets, without
much regularity, go down to the wharves. Fishing-boats
are everywhere, with new ones building, and on
most of the open spaces are "cod-flakes," or drying-places,
where the fish are piled when first landed,
preparatory to being cut up and packed in the extensive
packing-houses adjoining the wharves. Here
many hundreds are employed in preparing the fish
for market, both men and women working. The best
fish are either packed whole or cut into squares, so
they may be pressed by machinery into what are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
known as "cod-bricks," one and two-pound bricks
being put into forty-pound boxes for shipment. When
packed whole, the best fish are known as "white
clover," in this stage of what is called the fishery
"haymaking." This fish-packing is an enormous
industry, and the Gloucester product goes to all parts
of the world. But the fishery has its sombre side;
the vessels are small, rarely over one hundred tons,
and the crews are numerous, so that wrecks and loss
of life are frequent. Often a tremendous storm will
destroy a whole fleet on the "Banks," with no tidings
ever received; and scarcely a family exists in Gloucester
or its neighborhood that has not lost a member
at sea. Sometimes the badges of mourning are
universal.</p>

<p>An enormous development of rocks and boulders
is seen everywhere in and around Gloucester. The
houses are built upon rocks, the sea beats against
rocks; but though excellent building-material is here,
the houses are mostly of wood throughout the whole
Cape Ann district. There is almost universally
an ocean outlook over a sea of deepest blue. The
outer extremity of the harbor to the westward is a
long granite ridge ending in the popular watering-place
of Magnolia Point. Down on the Eastern
Point, alongside its terminating lighthouse, is a curious
granitic formation, the rocks reproducing an elderly
dame with muffled form and apron, known as "Mother
Ann," this rude image being locally regarded as representing,

in the eternal granite, the lady who named
the Cape, the royal mother of King Charles I. The
white flashing light upon Ten Pound Island between
them is said to have for one of its chief duties the
guiding of the mariner past the treacherous reefs of
Norman's Woe, just west of the harbor entrance,
which Longfellow has immortalized in his poem <i>The
Wreck of the Hesperus</i>. One "Goodman Norman"
and his son were among the first settlers near there,
and hence the name, but no record is found as to the
"Woe" he may have had. Neither is it known that
any wreck ever occurred on this famous reef. In
the winter of 1839 a terrific storm caused many
disasters around Cape Ann, and forty dead bodies,
one being a woman lashed to a spar, were washed on
the Gloucester shore. Longfellow read in a newspaper
the story of these wrecks and the horrible
details, one of the vessels being named the "Hesperus,"
and he somewhere saw a reference to "Norman's
Woe." This name so impressed him that he
determined to write a ballad on the wrecks. Late
one night, as he sat by the fireside smoking his pipe,
he conjured up the vivid scene and wrote the ballad.
He retired to bed, but, as he relates, it was not to
sleep; new thoughts crowded his mind, and he rose
and added them to the ballad, and at three o'clock in
the morning had finished his immortal poem. There
was no such wreck at the place, but his genius has
associated it with the iron-bound coast of Cape Ann,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
and Norman's Woe is a monument consecrated to one
of America's greatest poets.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE LAND'S END.</p>

<p>The impressive scenery and bold picturesqueness
all about attract many artists, who haunt the rocks
and sea views of Cape Ann. The whole district is
full of summer-homes, with flower-gardens and
shrubbery amid the rocks and boulders, and the
cliffs and ocean presenting an endless variety of
changing scenery. The outer extremity of the
Cape, long called Halibut Point, has been modernized
into the Land's End, thus being rightly named
as the termination of the great Massachusetts granite
ridge, which falls away sharply into the sea. Upon
the one hand Pigeon Cove, with its adjacent Sandy
Bay, indents the rocky buttress, while upon the other
side is Whale Cove. Just off the Land's End is the
noted Thatcher's Island, low-lying on the sea, elongated,
narrow and barren, with its tall twin lighthouses,
and having nearby, in front of Whale Cove,
the diminutive Milk Island. To the northward, off
Pigeon Cove, is another barren rock surmounted by
a lighthouse, Straitsmouth Island. These three outlying
islands were the "Three Turks' Heads," as
originally named by Captain John Smith. Thatcher's
Island has about eighty acres of mainly gravelly surface
strewn with boulders, being named from Anthony
Thatcher's shipwreck there in 1635 in the
most awful tempest known to colonial New England.
Rockport is a town of quarries extended around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Sandy Bay, protected by breakwaters, behind which
vessels come to load stone almost alongside the
quarry. Pigeon Cove is the port for shipping stone
taken out of Pigeon Hill, where the granite ridge is
humped up into a grand eminence. Lanesville, to
the north, is another large exporter of paving-blocks
and building-stone. Alongside is Folly Point, guarding
Folly Cove, at the northeastern extremity of the
Cape, and to the westward are the villages of Bay
View and Annisquam, with more quarries, and
having, not far away, flowing out to Ipswich Bay
through a lovely valley in the very heart of the
Cape, the attractive little Squam River. The people
of Cape Ann outside of Gloucester are almost all
quarrymen, their product, largely paving-blocks,
being shipped to all the seaboard cities. So extensive
is this trade that it is difficult to decide which
now brings the district most profit, the granite or the
fish. There is no doubt, however, that the greatest
fame of this celebrated Cape comes from its fisheries
and the venturesome men who make them so successful.
Edmund Burke, in the British House of Commons,
in 1774, thus spoke of these Massachusetts
fishermen: "No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries;
no climate that is not witness of their toils;
neither the perseverance of Holland, nor the activity
of France, nor the dexterous and firm sagacity of
English enterprise, ever carried their most perilous
mode of hardy industry to the extent to which it has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
been pursued by this recent people&mdash;a people who
are yet in the gristle, and not yet hardened into manhood."</p>

<p>For three centuries, almost, this perilous trade has
been carried on, and they are fully as daring and
even more enterprising now than in the colonial days.
Thus Whittier describes them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="center p2">THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND.</p>

<p>Narragansett Bay is one of the finest harbors on
the New England coast. It stretches thirty miles
inland, the rivers emptying into it making the water-power
for the numerous and extensive textile factories
of Rhode Island, which embraces the shores
surrounding and the islands within the bay. It
opens broadly, having beautiful shores, lined with
pleasant beaches which dissolve into low cliffs and
water-worn crags; for the character of the coast
gradually changes from the sandy borders of Long
Island Sound to the rocks of New England. Its
western boundary, stretching far out into the sea, is
the famous Point Judith, a long, low, narrow and
protruding sandspit thrust into the Atlantic, a headland
dreaded by the traveller, to whom "rounding
Point Judith" and its brilliant flashing beacon, thus
changing the course over the long ocean swells, when
voyaging upon a Sound steamer, means a great deal
in the way of tribute to Neptune. This headland
was always feared by the mariner, and we are romantically
told that in the colonial days a storm-tossed
vessel was driven in towards this shore, her
anxious skipper at the wheel, when suddenly his
bright-eyed daughter, Judith, called out, "Land,
father, I see the land!" His dim vision not discerning
it, he shouted, "Where away? Point, Judith,
point!" She pointed; he was warned; and quickly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
changing the course, escaped disaster. This story
was often repeated, so that in time the sailors gave
her name to the headland. It is an interesting tale,
but there are people, more prosaic, who insist that
the Point was really named after Judith Quincy, wife
of John Hull, the coiner of the ancient "pine-tree
shillings," who bought the land there from the Indians.
But, however named, and whoever the sponsor,
Judith is usually well-remembered by those circumnavigating
the dreaded Point.</p>

<p>Within Narragansett Bay, the chief island is
Aquidneck, or Rhode Island, about fifteen miles long
and of much fertility, having the best farm land in
New England, and at the southern end the noted
watering-place of Newport. This island furnishes
the first half of the long official title of the little
State&mdash;"Rhode Island and Providence Plantations."
The memory of the old Narragansett chieftain,
Canonicus, is preserved in Conanicut Island, west of
Rhode Island, and seven miles long, there being
between the two islands the capacious anchorage-ground
of Newport Harbor. This island in 1678
was named Jamestown in honor of King James, and
at its southern end, near the ruins of an old British
fort, is the famous Beaver Tail Light, the guide into
Newport harbor, the oldest lighthouse in America,
dating from 1667. Roger Williams, who founded
the "Providence Plantations," distributed various
names to the other islands, several of them now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
popular resorts, among these titles, which represent
the varying phases of his early emotions, being Prudence,
Patience, Hope and Despair, while some later
colonists with different ideas, evidently named Dutch
Island, Hog Island, and the Starved Goat. Rhode
Island is the smallest State in the Union, though
among the first in manufactures, and in wealth proportionately
to population. It has barely twelve
hundred square miles of surface, of which more than
one-eighth is water, and the highest land, Durfee
Hill, is elevated only eight hundred feet.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE LAND OF THE NARRAGANSETTS.</p>

<p>The region back of Point Judith and around Narragansett
Bay was the home of the Narragansett
Indians, who were early made, by Roger Williams,
the friends of the white man. When the Pilgrims
landed at Plymouth, there were said to be thirty
thousand of them, but they were afterwards wasted
by pestilence, and when Williams fled to Providence
and was received by them, he said they had twelve
towns within twenty miles, and five thousand warriors.
They fought the Pequots, to the westward, but
were friendly with the tribes of Massachusetts, to
which they really gave the name, for, living in a comparatively
flat country, they described these tribes as
belonging "near the great hills or mountains," which
is the literal meaning of the word, they telling Williams
it meant the many hills of that State, including
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the "blue hills of Milton." Canonicus and Miantonomoh
were the great chiefs of the Narragansetts,
described by the early colonists as wise, brave and
magnanimous. The former made the grant of the
lands at Providence to Roger Williams, and was his
firm friend. The latter, the nephew and successor
of Canonicus, joined the Puritans under Mason at
Pequot Hill in the attack and defeat of the Pequots.
In their original theology they looked forward to a
mystic realm in the far southwest where the gods
and pure spirits dwelt, while the souls of murderers,
thieves and liars were doomed forever to wander
abroad. Their friendship with the whites ended in
1675, however, when King Philip incited them to
join in his war, and the colonists attacked them on a
hill in a pine and cedar swamp near Kingston, west
of Narragansett Bay, where scanty remains still
exist of their fortifications. It was in December,
amid the winter snows, and after a furious struggle
their wigwams were fired, and in the most blinding
confusion a band of warriors dashed out and covered
the retreat of fully three thousand of their
people, leaving the whites in possession. Both sides
had heavy losses, but the result was the scattering
and final annihilation of the tribe. This was the
famous "Fort Fight in Narragansett," of which the
memorial of the Connecticut Legislature says, "The
bitter cold, the tarled swamp, the tedious march, the
strong fort, the numerous and stubborn enemy they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
contended with for their God, King and country, be
their trophies over death."</p>

<p>To the westward, beyond the Rhode Island border,
lived Uncas, the enemy of Miantonomoh. His domain
extended to the river Thames, and he had been
a chief of the Pequots, who revolted in 1634 against
the Sachem Sassacus and joined the Mohicans, being
chosen their chief sachem. He was friendly to the
colonists, and by sagacious alliances with them increased
the power of his tribe, which had previously
been in a relatively subordinate position. He helped
defeat the Pequots, and became so strong that he
was described as the "most powerful and prosperous
prince in New England." He sold the shores of the
Thames River to the whites, reserving a small tract
on the river bank, and in 1660 disposed of the present
site of Norwich, Connecticut, to a nomadic church
from Saybrook, for £70. He held his people friendly
to the colonists, even in King Philip's war, frequently
visited their capitals at Hartford and Boston, and
after reigning nearly fifty years, died in 1683. He
is described as crafty, cruel and rapacious, but, as the
head of a savage people, far-sighted and sagacious;
skillful and fearless as a military leader. His holding
aloof from the Indian alliances adverse to the colonists
and fighting with the whites against the powerful
hostile tribes, are regarded as having really saved
colonial New England. His quarrel with Miantonomoh
resulted in the battle of Sachem's Plain, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
outskirts of Norwich, in 1643. This was then a
Mohican village, and Miantonomoh marched to attack
it with nine hundred Narragansetts, Uncas defending
with five hundred warriors. By a preconcerted plan,
Uncas invited him to a parley, and while it was going
on, and the Narragansetts were off their guard, the
Mohicans made a sudden onslaught, defeating and
pursuing them for a long distance. Hundreds of the
Narragansetts were slain, and Miantonomoh, being
captured, was taken prisoner to the English at Hartford.
He was ultimately surrendered back to Uncas,
who took him again to the Sachem's Plain, where he
was put to death, the historian says, "by the advice
and consent of the English magistrates and elders."
A monument marks the place of execution, inscribed
"Miantonomoh, 1643." His son, Nanunteno, who
succeeded, led the tribe into King Philip's war, as he
hated the colonists, and being captured, he declined
to treat with them for a pardon, saying, when threatened
with death, "I like it well; I shall die before
my heart is soft or I have spoken anything unworthy
of myself," whereupon he was shot. He was "acting
herein," says old Cotton Mather, "as if, by a Pythagorean
metempsychosis, some old Roman ghost had
possessed the body of this Western Pagan, like
Attilius Regulus."</p>

<p>A few miles south of Norwich is the ancient fortress
of Uncas on a hill, and a handful of weak half-breeds
are all that remain of his famous people. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the city, on Sachem Street, near the Yantic Falls, is
a little cemetery in a cluster of pine trees. This,
centuries ago, was the burial-place of the Mohican
chiefs, and the whole line of sachems is here interred,
down to the last of them, Mazeen, buried in 1826
in the presence of a small remnant of the tribe.
Ancient stones mark their graves, and in the centre
is an obelisk in memory of Uncas, of which President
Andrew Jackson laid the foundation-stone. The
Yantic and Shetucket Rivers unite at Norwich to
form the Thames, and the town has arisen around
their admirable water-powers, which serve many
mills. The city has about twenty thousand people,
being in a beautiful situation between and on the
acclivities adjoining the two rivers. The praises of
the Yantic Falls were sung by Mrs. Sigourney and
others, but their glory has departed, for the stream
has been diverted into another channel, leaving a
deep cutting in the hard rock, the bottom filled with
curiously-piled and water-worn boulders.</p>

<p class="center p2">ASCENDING NARRAGANSETT BAY.</p>

<p>On the western shore of Narragansett Bay, just
inside of Point Judith, stood the little fishing village
of Narragansett Pier, originally named from its
ancient, sea-battered and ruined pier, built for a
breakwater in early times, which has since become
one of the most fashionable New England coast resorts,
having many large hotels spreading in imposing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
array along the shore. The smooth sands of its
bathing-beach look out upon Newport far over the
bay and behind Conanicut Island in front. Upon
the southern border of this beach there are precipitous
cliffs against which the Atlantic Ocean breakers
dash, the last rocks on the coast of the United States
until the Florida reefs are reached. The famous
Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry was a native of
this town, born in 1785, a midshipman in the war
with Tripoli, and the victor in the naval battle on
Lake Erie in 1813. His brother, Commodore M. C.
Perry, born in Newport in 1794, commanded the
noted expedition to Japan in 1852-54, and concluded
the treaty with that country, cementing the friendly
relations with the United States ever since existing.
The celebrated portrait painter Gilbert Stuart was
also a native of this place, born in 1755, his portrait
of Washington being regarded as the best existing.
The western shores of the bay north of the Pier are
lined with coast resorts. Here is quaint old Wickford,
on Coweset Bay, which has a ferry twelve miles
across to Newport, and still exhibits the "Rolling
Rock," where Canonicus and Roger Williams are
said to have signed their compact, and the old Blockhouse
built for a defense in 1641. Farther northward
is the ancient Shawomet, whither Samuel Gorton
came, changing its name to Old Warwick in
honor of his friend and patron, the Earl of Warwick.
It appears that Gorton, a layman, who had a penchant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
for theological disputation, made himself obnoxious
to the Plymouth Puritans in the early colonial time,
and they banished him in 1637. He went to Newport
and expressed his opinions too freely, and was
banished thence in 1641. Wandering to Providence,
he was driven from there to Cranston, nearby, the
next year, and again expelled from Cranston a few
months later, and he finally settled at Shawomet.
But they still pursued him, and in 1643 a detachment
of troops came from Boston and took him and
ten others back as prisoners, and they were tried and
sentenced as "damnable heretics" to banishment
from America. Gorton sought Warwick's protection,
and the Earl sent him back to Shawomet, where he
lived undisturbed, but, after changing its name, spent
the rest of his life in publishing pamphlets attacking
Massachusetts and Rhode Island, among them being
the "Antidote Against Pharisaic Teachers" and
"Simplicitie's Defence against Seven-Headed Policy."
The next thing of note occurring in Warwick
was the disfranchisement, in 1652, of the clerk of the
unfortunate town on seven charges: first, calling the
officers of the town rogues and thieves; second, calling
all the town rogues and thieves; third, threatening
to kill all the mares in town, etc. In 1676 the
Indians attacked and burnt it, and since, it has had
little history. General Greene was a native of Warwick,
born in 1742.</p>

<p>In sailing up Narragansett Bay, one is struck with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
the universality of the prolific crop of these waters,&mdash;the
clam. Many of the inhabitants seem to spend
much of their time gathering them; men and boys
in boats are dredging all the coves and shallows for
the clams, seizing enormous numbers by the skillful
use of their handy double rakes. These people are
proud of their home institution, the Rhode Island
"clam-bake," which is a main-stay of all the shore
resorts, and is considered a connecting link, binding
them to the Narragansetts, who originated it. To
properly conduct the "clam-bake" a wood fire is
built in the open air, upon a layer of large stones,
and when these are sufficiently heated, the embers
and ashes are swept off, the hot stones covered with
sea-weed, and clams in the shells, with other delicacies,
put upon it, being enveloped by masses of sea-weed
and sail-cloths to keep in the steam. The clams
are thus baked by the heated stones, and steamed
and seasoned by the moisture from the salt sea-weed.
The coverings are then removed, the clams opened,
and the feasting begins. With appetite whetted by
the delicious breezes coming over the bright waters
of the bay, the meal is relished beyond description.
There are millions of clams thus consumed, but their
growth is enormous, and the supply seems perennial.
The chief of these places is Rocky Point, a forest-covered
promontory, the favorite resort of the population
of the Rhode Island capital, where the "clam-bakes"
have acquired great fame.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">ROGER WILLIAMS.</p>

<p>There flows southeastward out of Massachusetts
the Blackstone River into Rhode Island, and going
over Pawtucket Falls it then becomes for a brief
space the Pawtucket River, and finally, at its mouth,
the Seeconk River, making part of Providence harbor
and one of the heads of Narragansett Bay. The
shores of this river swarm with industrial operatives,
for its valley is one of the greatest regions of textile
mills in the world, and half the people of Rhode
Island live in the chief city on its banks, Providence.
Nine centuries ago the Norsemen are said to have
sailed up into this region, which they called Vinland,
but the first settlement was not made until 1636.
The brave and pious Welshman, Roger Williams, the
heretical Salem preacher whom the Puritans in 1635
banished from Massachusetts, went afoot through the
forest to the Seeconk Plains along the lower Blackstone
River, and halting there, lived with the Narragansetts,
who were always his firm friends. But the
wrathful Puritans would not long permit this, and
ordered him to move on, so that in the spring of
1636, with five companions, he embarked in a log
canoe and floated down the Seeconk River, his movements
being watched by Indian groups upon the
banks. He crossed over the stream finally, and
landed on what has since been called "What Cheer
Rock," on the eastern edge of Providence, thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
named because, when Williams stepped ashore, some
of the Indians saluted him with the pleasant greeting,
"What cheer, Notop?" (friend)&mdash;words that are
still carefully preserved throughout Providence and
the State in the names of banks, buildings, and various
associations. He regarded this as a decidedly
good omen, and started a settlement, calling it Providence,
"in grateful acknowledgment of God's merciful
providence to him in his distress." His exalted
piety was beyond question, and not only is the religious
spirit in which the city was founded indicated
by its name, but even in the titles of the streets are
incorporated the cardinal virtues and the higher emotions,
as in Joy Street, Faith Street, Happy Street,
Hope Street, Friendship Street, Benefit Street, Benevolent
Street, and many more. We are told that
his early colonists adopted the Indian foods, such as
parched corn, which the aborigines called "anhuminea,"
from which has come the name of hominy,
and the famous Narragansett mixture of corn and
beans, the "m'sickquatash," which has become succotash.</p>

<p>Roger Williams in Rhode Island, in 1639, became
a Baptist, and the "Society of the First Baptist
Church," which he founded that year in Providence,
claims to be the oldest Baptist organization in
America. But Williams seems to have been somewhat
unstable, for he only remained with this church
as pastor four years, then withdrawing, as he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
grave doubts of the validity of his own baptism. It
appears that when this church was started, a layman,
Ezekiel Holliman, first baptized Williams, and then
Williams baptized Holliman and the others. When
he withdrew, it was not only from the pastoral relation,
but he ceased worshipping with the brethren,
and his conscientious scruples finally brought him to
the conclusion that there is "no regularly constituted
church on earth, nor any person authorized to administer
any church ordinance, nor could there be
until new apostles were sent by the great Head of
the Church, for whose coming he was seeking."
During many years thereafter he held his religious
meetings in a grove. This venerable Baptist society
which Roger Williams founded built a new church in
1726, and in its honor they had a "grand dinner."
The elaborate banquet of those primitive days consisted
of the whole congregation dining upon one
sheep, one pound of butter, two loaves of bread, and
a peck of peas, at a cost of twenty-seven shillings.
Their white wooden church, with its surmounting
steeple, overlooks the city from a slope rising above
Providence River.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE CITY OF PROVIDENCE.</p>

<p>Providence is beautifully situated on the hills at
the head of Narragansett Bay, and its centre is a fine
new Union Railway Station, completed in 1897.
Near by is the massive City Hall, one of the chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
public buildings in Rhode Island, a granite structure
costing $1,500,000. In high relief upon its front is
a medallion bust of the founder of the little State,
Roger Williams, wearing the typical sugar-loaf hat.
A feature of this impressive building is the magnificent
stair-hall, lighted from above; and from the
surmounting tower there is a wide view over the city
and suburbs, and far down the bay towards the ocean.
In front is the public square, with a stately Soldiers'
and Sailors' Monument of blue Westerly granite,
bearing the names of nearly seventeen hundred men
of Rhode Island who fell in the Civil War, and
guarded by well-executed bronze statues representing
the different arms of the service. Facing it is a
statue in heroic bronze of the Rhode Island General
Burnside, who died in 1881. These works are
artistic, but the priceless art gem in Providence is
the exquisite little picture of "The Hours," painted
on a sheet of ivory six by seven inches, in London,
by the great portrait and miniature painter, Edward
Greene Malbone, of Newport&mdash;the three Grecian
nymphs, Eunomia, Dice and Irene, representing the
Past, Present and Future. The President of the
Royal Academy said of it, "I have seen a picture,
painted by a young man of the name of Malbone,
which no man in England could excel." This is his
masterpiece, one of the most admired paintings in
America, and is kept carefully in the Athenæum (to
which it was presented by a public subscription in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
1853), a solid little granite house built on the hillside,
not far from the Baptist church.</p>

<p>Farther up this hill are the campus and rows of
buildings of Brown University, the great Rhode
Island Baptist College with seven hundred students,
founded in 1764, and bearing the name of one of the
leading families of the wealthy manufacturing house
of Brown &amp; Ives. The campus is shaded with fine
old elms, and some of the newer buildings are handsome
and elaborate structures. Around this university,
and all through the extensive suburbs, are the
splendid homes of the capitalists and mill-owners of
the State, who have made this hill, rising between
the Providence and Seeconk Rivers, the most attractive
residential section. Benefit Street, on the hill,
is lined with the palaces of these textile millionaires.
Providence is, in fact, a city of many hills, and its
houses are mostly of wood. Extensive sections can be
traversed without seeing a single brick or stone building.
There is a large railway traffic, but only a small
trade by sea, beyond bringing coal and cotton, though
the city formerly enjoyed an extensive China trade.
Like all the Rhode Island towns it has many mills and
much wealth, and there are thirty or forty banks to
take care of its money. Besides textiles, its mills
make locomotives and Corliss steam-engines, silverware
and jewelry, cigars, rifles and stoves, gimlet-pointed
wood-screws, tortoise-shell work and cocoanut
dippers, cottonseed and peanut oils, and many other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
things, not overlooking the famous "Pain-killer," for
the ills of humanity, which is consumed by the hundred
thousand gallons in all parts of the world. The
"Pain-killer" factory was always one of the lions of
the town, although now the new Rhode Island State
House, finished in 1898, also commands great public
admiration. This is a huge dome-surmounted building
in Renaissance, constructed of Georgia marble
and pink granite. But Providence, above everything
else, reveres the memory of Roger Williams,
who died in 1683, and is interred in the old North
Burying Ground. On Abbott Street is carefully
preserved, as a precious relic, a small old house with
quaint peaked roof, built in the seventeenth century,
and reverenced as the place where he held some of
his religious meetings. His bronze statue ornaments
the Roger Williams Park to which Broad Street
leads, a beautiful tract of about one hundred acres,
surrounding the quaint gambrel-roofed house in
which lived his great-great-granddaughter, Betsy
Williams, for many years, who gave this domain to
the city in 1871, as her tribute to his memory.
Here are refreshments served at "What Cheer Cottage."
But the most treasured memorial of the
founder is his original landing-place of "What
Cheer Rock," where the Indians greeted him alongside
the Seeconk River,&mdash;a pile of slaty rocks, enclosed
by a railing, near the foot of Williams Street,
down by the waterside.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">PROVIDENCE TO WORCESTER.</p>

<p>We ascend the Seeconk River to Pawtucket, about
five miles distant, a busy manufacturing town of
thirty thousand people, noted as the place where
Samuel Slater introduced the cotton manufacture
into the United States in 1790, the original Slater
mill still standing. The Pawtucket Falls of fifty
feet give the valuable water-power which has made
the place, and here are some of the greatest thread
factories in the world. The town extends up into
the villages of Central and Valley Falls, and the
enormous power furnished by the river is drawn
upon at different levels from several dams. All sorts
of cotton textiles, muslins and calicoes are made, and
the slopes running up from the valley, with the plateaus
above, are covered with the operatives' houses.
This town has the most attractive situation on the
Blackstone River, which here changes its name to
the Pawtucket, and finally to the Seeconk. Samuel
Slater, who started it, was a native of Belper, in
Derbyshire, England, having worked there for both
Strutt and Arkwright, the fathers of the textile industries.
Learning that American bounties had been
offered for the introduction of Arkwright's patents in
cotton-spinning, he crossed the ocean, landing at
Newport in 1789. Here he heard that Moses Brown
had attempted cotton-spinning by machinery in
Rhode Island. He wrote Brown, telling what he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
could do, and received a reply in which Brown said
his attempt had been unsuccessful, and added: "If
thou canst do this thing, I invite thee to come to
Rhode Island and have the credit and the profit of
introducing cotton manufacture into America." Slater
went to Pawtucket, and on December 21, 1790, he
started three carding-machines and spinning-frames
of seventy-two spindles. He afterwards became
very prominent, building large mills at Pawtucket
and elsewhere, and the impetus thus given the place
made it the leading American manufacturing centre
for a half-century. The Indian name of the falls
was retained by the city.</p>

<p>The Blackstone River was named after the recluse
Anglican clergyman, Rev. William Blackstone, who,
as heretofore stated, first settled Boston about 1625.
When he found, after a brief experience, that he
could not get on with the Puritan colonists, who came
in there too numerously, he sold out and "retired
into the wilderness." He wandered for over forty
miles into the forests, and during more than forty
years made his home on the banks of this stream
among the Indians, not far above Pawtucket Falls.
He lived there in his hermit home at Study Hill
among his books, the river rushing by, and the Providence
and Worcester Branch of the New Haven
Consolidated Railroad now cuts its route deeply
through his hill, running among the dams, and in
some cases over them, on its way up the busy valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
of this very crooked river. Its waters, which do
such good service for so many mills, become more
and more polluted as they descend, so that its lower
course is a malodorous and dark-colored stream. The
river is about forty-five miles long, rising in the
hills adjacent to Worcester and flowing in winding
reaches towards the southeast, descending over five
hundred feet to Providence. The mills, however,
have grown vastly beyond its capacity as a water-power,
so that auxiliary steam is now largely used.
Numerous ponds and other feeders accumulate a vast
amount of water for the Blackstone in Southern
Massachusetts, and its lower course for nearly thirty
miles is a succession of dams, canals and mills, making
one of the greatest factory districts in existence.
Over a half-million people work and live in this busy
valley, the operatives being chiefly French Canadians,
Swedes, and the various British races, the
French preponderating in some of the towns. The
Yankees long ago left, seeking better pay elsewhere,
being replaced by a more contented people satisfied
to work in mills. Most of the huge factories lining
the river are owned by wealthy corporations having
their head offices in Boston or Providence, and it is
said that, the buildings being without signs or names,
many of the operatives actually do not know who
they work for. These mills are four and five stories
high, often a thousand feet long, with hundreds of
windows and ponderous stairway-towers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>Ascending the river, the factory settlements of
Lonsdale, Ashton, Albion and Manville are passed,
and we come to Woonsocket Hill, one of the highest
in Rhode Island. Here the river goes around various
bends admirably arranged for conducting its waters
through the mills, and the town of Woonsocket is
built where twenty thousand people make cotton and
woollen cloths, the noted "Harris cassimere" having
been long the chief manufacture at the Social Mills.
To the northward, Woonsocket spreads into the towns
of Blackstone and Waterford, also industrial hives;
and finally, having followed the river up to its
sources, the route leads to Worcester, the second
city of Massachusetts, forty-five miles west of Boston,
styled the "heart of the Commonwealth," with a
population of over one hundred thousand people. Its
chief newspaper, the <i>Massachusetts Spy</i>, is noted as
having actually started as a spy upon the royalists in
the exciting times preceding the Revolutionary War,
and is still a prosperous publication. It was at a
Worcester banquet in 1776 that the "Sons of Freedom"
drank the noted toast: "May the freedom and
independence of America endure till the sun grows
dim with age and this earth returns to chaos; perpetual
itching without the benefit of scratching to the
enemies of America!" Worcester is a great manufacturing
city, but has almost lost its New England
population from the steady Yankee migration westward,
they being replaced in its numerous mills by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
French Canadians, Swedes and Irish, the latter predominating.
It has a noble Soldiers' Monument, a
splendid railway station, and the fine buildings of
the Massachusetts Lunatic Asylum standing on the
highest hill in the suburbs. Its new white marble
City Hall, completed in 1898, is an imposing edifice.
The huge Washburn &amp; Moen Wire Works are on Salisbury
Pond, in the outskirts. Among the interesting
old dwellings is the Bancroft House, where the
historian, George Bancroft, was born, in 1800, dying
in 1891. The great attraction of Worcester is Lake
Quinsigamond, on the eastern verge, a long, deep,
narrow loch, stretching among the hills four miles
away, with little gems of islands and villa-bordered
shores. Scattered over the distant rim of enclosing
hills are several typical Yankee villages, with their
church-spires set against the horizon. Worcester
had a chequered colonial career, the Indians repeatedly
driving out the early settlers, until they built a
fortress-like church on the Common, where each man
attended on the Sabbath, carrying his musket. These
resolute colonists were Puritans, bent on enforcing
their own ideas, for when a few Scotch Presbyterians
came in 1720, and built a church of that creed, it
was declared a "cradle of heresy" and demolished.
A considerable number of the French Acadians, exiled
from Nova Scotia in the eighteenth century,
came to Worcester, and their descendants are now
among its prominent people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>New England, as is well known, was forced to
adopt manufacturing, because the inhabitants could
not extract a living from the soil. It is difficult to
say where is the most sterile region, but in Massachusetts
it seems to be generally agreed that the town
of Ware, on the Ware River, northwest of Worcester,
is hard to beat in this respect. It is a picturesquely
located mill-village, with a soil that is stony and
sterile. The original grant of the land was made to
soldiers as a reward for bravery in King Philip's
War. They thankfully accepted the gift and went
there, but after examination left, and sold all their
domain at the rate of about two cents an acre.
President Dwight, of Yale College, rode through the
town, but never wanted to see it again, saying regretfully,
in describing the land: "It is like self-righteousness;
the more a man has of it, the poorer he is."
Someone wrote a poem describing the creation of the
place, of which this a specimen stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Dame Nature once, while making land,</p>
<p>Had refuse left of stone and sand.</p>
<p>She viewed it well, then threw it down</p>
<p>Between Coy's Hill and Belchertown,</p>
<p>And said, 'You paltry stuff, lie there,</p>
<p>And make a town, and call it Ware.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="center p2">MOUNT HOPE BAY.</p>

<p>On the northeastern verge of Narragansett Bay is
Mount Hope Bay, its shores attractive alike in lovely
scenery and the most interesting tradition. It is also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
a region of most venerable antiquity in America.
Hither came the ancient Norsemen Vikings, who explored
it, and sojourned there almost a thousand
years ago. These wandering Norsemen, early colonizing
Iceland and Greenland, are said to have discovered
the mainland of North America in the tenth
century, the energetic Leif, a son of Eric the Red,
afterwards, in the year 1001, sailing along the
American coast, and finding first, Helluland, or the
"Flat Land," supposed to be Newfoundland, then
Mark Land, or the "Wood Land," now Nova Scotia,
and Vinland, or the "Vine Land," being the coasts
of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and wintering in
Narragansett and Mount Hope Bays. The next year
Leif's brother, Thorvald, came along these coasts
with thirty men, and also passed a winter in Mount
Hope Bay. The following season he sent a party of
explorers hither, and in the year 1004 he again came
personally, and was killed in a skirmish with the Indians,
his companions returning to Greenland. There
seem to have been subsequent Norsemen visits, and
the name of Vinland was given by them on account
of the profusion of vines growing on the shores and
islands, which was a novelty to these wanderers from
the far north.</p>

<p>Mount Hope Bay is the broadening estuary of
Taunton Great River, and the elongated peninsula
of Bristol Neck divides it from Narragansett Bay to
the westward, stretching up to Providence. Upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Taunton Great River is a magnificent water-power
which has produced the success of Taunton, a busy
manufacturing town of thirty thousand people,
where they make locomotives and tacks, bricks,
screws and britannia ware, its name coming from
Taunton in Somersetshire, its founder having been
Elizabeth Pool, a pious Puritan lady of that place.
When the first settlers explored the river they made
a wonderful antiquarian discovery. Upon the shore,
below Taunton, and opposite what are now the gardens
and pleasure-grounds of Dighton, was found
the famous "Writing Rock," lying partly submerged
by the waterside, and when the tide is out, presenting
a smooth face slightly inclined towards the river.
It is a large greenstone boulder, the color changed to
dusky red by the elements, and it now has the faint
impression of hieroglyphics on its surface that have
been almost effaced by the action of the water. In
the early colonial days these marks were very distinct,
and even after the beginning of the nineteenth
century they could be plainly distinguished from the
deck of a passing vessel. These inscriptions on the
Dighton rock excited much wonder, and were generally
attributed to the Norsemen. Old Cotton
Mather described it, saying that among the "curiosities
of New England, one is that of a mighty rock,
on a perpendicular side whereof, by a river which at
high tide covers part of it, there are very deeply
engraved, no man alive knows how or when, about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
half a score lines, near ten foot long and a foot and
a half broad, filled with strange characters." Another
learned man speaks of them as "Punic inscriptions
which remain to this day," made by the Ph&oelig;nicians.
Below, and near Fall River, many years
ago, there was exhumed a skeleton in sitting posture,
wearing a brass breast-plate and a belt of brass
armor. Much marvel resulted from this important
discovery, which was thought to have produced a
veritable dead Viking, and it is said to have inspired
Longfellow's poem of "The Skeleton in Armor":</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Speak! speak! thou fearful guest!</p>
<p>Who, with thy hollow breast</p>
<p>Still in rude armor drest,</p>
<p class="i1">Comest to daunt me!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Wrapt not in Eastern balms,</p>
<p>But with thy fleshless palms</p>
<p>Stretched, as if asking alms,</p>
<p class="i1">Why dost thou haunt me?"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus he answers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"I was a Viking old!</p>
<p>My deeds, though manifold,</p>
<p>No Skald in song has told,</p>
<p class="i1">No Saga taught thee!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Take heed, that in thy verse,</p>
<p>Thou dost the tale rehearse,</p>
<p>Else dread a dead man's curse;</p>
<p class="i1">For this I sought thee."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>And then the poet unfolds his weird and romantic
history. Despite the Norsemen traditions, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
it is regarded as more probable that both the hieroglyphics
and the skeleton were of Indian origin.</p>

<p class="center p2">KING PHILIP.</p>

<p>Upon the western shore of Mount Hope Bay is the
town of Bristol, quiet, with wide, grassy, tree-shaded
streets leading down to the waterside, now a pleasant
summer-resort, having a ferry over to Fall River.
Farther up the peninsula is Warren, with its factories.
In Bristol rises the splendid isolated eminence
of Mount Hope, which gives the bay its name. Its
rounded summit is a mass of quartzite rock, almost
covered by grass. It is hardly three hundred feet
high, but being the most elevated spot anywhere
around, has a grand outlook, every town in Rhode
Island being visible from it, and all the islands of
Narragansett Bay, while far to the southward, upon
distant Aquidneck, Newport gleams in the sunlight.
Eastward, across Mount Hope Bay, the city of Fall
River, with its rising terraces of huge granite mills,
is built apparently into the sloping side of a ledge of
rocks. Upon this mountain lived the famous chief,
King Philip, and from it, with his warrior band, he
sallied forth to carry slaughter and rapine among the
Puritan settlements. The eastern side of Mount Hope
falls off precipitously to the bay, and when he was
finally surprised by the colonists in his lair, he is
said to have rolled down this steep declivity like a
barrel. The mountain top is now known as "King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Philip's Seat;" there is a natural excavation in the
mountain side, called "King Philip's Throne;" and
from the foot the waters of "Philip's Spring" flow
away, a little purling brook, out to Taunton River.
One disgruntled early colonial annalist described the
place as "Philip's Sty at Mount Hope." The greatest
tradition of this region tells of the ambush, surprise
and death of this famous sachem, the "Last of the
Wampanoags."</p>

<p>The name of Wampanoag means "the men of the
East Land," or the Indians to the eastward of Narragansett
Bay. When the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth,
the noted Massasoit was the Grand Sachem
of the Wampanoags, or Pokanokets, whose territory
embraced most of the country from Narragansett
Bay to Cape Cod. The tribe had previously numbered
thirty thousand, but a pestilence had reduced
them to a small figure, barely three hundred, not long
before the arrival of the "Mayflower." Massasoit
felt his weakness and made friends with the colonists,
his treaties of peace being faithfully kept for a half-century.
The old sachem lived north of Mount
Hope, at Sowamset, now the town of Warren, where
his favorite "Massasoit Spring" still pours out its
libations. He died in 1661, at the age of eighty,
leaving two sons, Mooanum and Metacomet. Shortly
after his death, these sons went to Plymouth to confirm
the treaties with the whites, and were so much
pleased with their reception that they asked to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
given English names. The colonial court accordingly
conferred upon them the names of Alexander
and Philip. The former was chief sachem, but died
within a year, Philip succeeding. During the next
decade he lived in comparative friendliness, but was
always unsatisfied and restless. He grew to distrust
the colonists, and never could be made to comprehend
their religion. When John Eliot, the Indian apostle,
who converted so many, preached before him, Philip
pulled a button off Eliot's doublet, saying in contempt
that he valued it more than the discourse, a remark
which led pious old Cotton Mather to exclaim, in horror,
"the monster!" It was not long before the
peaceful relations were broken, and, after 1671,
Philip travelled among the tribes throughout New
England, exciting them to a crusade against the colonists,
and forming a powerful league, including the
Narragansetts, who had been friendly. The result
was the most desolating Indian war from which the
colonies ever suffered. The whites were everywhere
attacked, but made heroic defense, and in 1675-6
they defeated all the tribes, the Narragansetts and
Wampanoags being practically annihilated.</p>

<p class="center p2">KING PHILIP'S DEATH.</p>

<p>Defeated, and left without resources, the savage
king was then hunted from one place to another, finally
seeking refuge in his eyrie on Mount Hope, with a
handful of followers. Here Captain Church attacked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
him, and on August 12, 1676, he was killed by a bullet
fired by an Indian. In Church's annals of that terrible
war the story is told of the death of this chief,
the last of his line. Philip was ambushed and completely
surprised on the mountain, and running
away, rolled down its side, the Indians trying to
escape through a swamp at the foot. The attacking
party was posted around the swamp in couples, hidden
from view. Philip, partly clad, ran directly
towards two of the ambush, an Englishman and an
Indian. The former fired, but missed him; then the
Indian fired twice, sending one bullet through his
heart and the other not more than two inches from
it. Philip fell dead upon his face in the mud and
water; most of his companions escaped. In Church's
recital is told what followed:</p>

<p>"Captain Church ordered Philip's body to be
pulled out of the mire on to the upland. So some
of Captain Church's Indians took hold of him by his
stockings, and some by his small breeches, being
otherwise naked, and drew him through the mud to
the upland; and a doleful, great, naked, dirty beast
he looked like. Captain Church then said that, forasmuch
as he had caused many an Englishman's body
to lie unburied and rot above ground, not one of his
bones should be buried. And, calling his old executioner,
bid him behead and quarter him. Accordingly
he came with his hatchet and stood over him,
but before he struck, he made a small speech, directing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
it to Philip, and said 'he had been a very great
man, and had made many a man afraid of him, but
so big as he was, he would now chop him in pieces.'
And so went to work and did as he was ordered.
Philip having one very remarkable hand, being very
much scarred, occasioned by the splitting of a pistol
in it formerly, Captain Church gave the head and
that hand to Aldermon, the Indian who shot him, to
show to such gentlemen as would bestow gratuities
upon him, and accordingly he got many a penny by
it. This being on the last day of the week, the
Captain with his company returned to the island
(Aquidneck), tarried there until Tuesday, and then
went off and ranged through all the woods to Plymouth,
and received their premium, which was 30
shillings per head for the enemies which they had
killed or taken, instead of all wages, and Philip's
head went at the same price. Methinks it is scanty
reward and poor encouragement, though it was better
than what had been some time before. For this
much they received four shillings and sixpence a
man, which was all the reward they had, except the
honor of killing Philip."</p>

<p>When the party brought Philip's head to Plymouth,
the Puritan meeting was celebrating a solemn
thanksgiving, and quoting, again, the words of old Cotton
Mather, "God sent them in the head of a leviathan
for a thanksgiving feast." This head was exposed on
a gibbet at Plymouth for twenty years, as the arch-enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
of the colony. But things were different afterwards.
The "monster" of the seventeenth century
became a martyr in the nineteenth century.
Irving wrote King Philip's biography; Southey was
his bard; and Edwin Forrest nobly impersonated
him. Thus the great Metacomet, in the light of history,
is regarded as sinned against as well as sinning,
for he was trying to drive the invader from his native
land. The resistless westward march of the white
man overcame him, the first of a long line of famous
Indians to fall in front of American colonization.</p>

<p class="center p2">FALL RIVER.</p>

<p>Across Mount Hope Bay is Fall River, in Massachusetts,
now the leading American city in cotton-spinning
and the manufacture of print cloths. Its
huge granite mills stand in ranks, like the platoons
of a marching regiment, upon the successive rising
terraces of the eastern shore. Nestling among the
hills above the town are the extensive Watuppa
ponds, long and narrow lakes, spreading eight or ten
miles back upon the higher plateau. These, with
other tributary ponds, cover about twelve square
miles surface, discharging through a comparatively
small stream, yet one carrying a large volume of
water. This is the Fall River, dammed at the outlet
of the ponds, and barely two miles long, but running
so steeply down hill that within about eight hundred
yards distance it descends one hundred and thirty-six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
feet, thus being appropriately named, and in turn
giving its name to the town gathered around this admirable
water-power. The mills, however, have
grown so far beyond the ability of the water-wheels
that they now run chiefly by steam, and Fall River
has a population approximating one hundred thousand.
The prolific granite quarries in the surrounding
hills have furnished the stone for these imposing
mills, and also for the chief buildings. Although a
New England manufacturing city of the first rank, it
is not a Yankee settlement, for the operatives are
chiefly English, Irish, Welsh and French Canadians.
When the settlement began, it was called Freetown,
and afterwards Troy, but the name of the stream
finally became so popular that the others were discarded,
and Fall River was adopted officially upon
its incorporation as a city. The rocky environment
enabled it to cheaply construct the grand mill buildings,
and thus had much to do with its success.</p>

<p class="center p2">NEWPORT OF AQUIDNECK.</p>

<p>The eastern side of Narragansett Bay is chiefly
occupied by Aquidneck, or Rhode Island, upon which
is the queen of American seaside resorts, Newport.
Aquidneck is the Indian "Isle of Peace," the word
literally meaning "floating on the water," and its
southwestern extremity broadens into a wide peninsula
of almost level and quite fertile land, making a
plateau elevated about fifty feet above the sea. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
island is fifteen miles long and from three to four
miles wide, and this plateau rests upon rock, the
strata making cliffs all around it, with coves worked
into them by the waters, presenting smooth sand
beaches having intervening bold promontories. The
southeastern border of this plateau, facing the Atlantic,
has an irregular front of little bays and projections,
with the waves dashing against the bases
of the cliffs and among the rocks profusely strewn
beyond them. Behind the western extremity of the
island is Brenton's Point, projecting in such a way as
to protect the inner harbor of Newport. Here are
the wharves, facing the westward, and the ancient
part of the town, its narrow streets and older houses
covering considerable surface. The harbor is protected
by a breakwater, and beyond is Conanicut
Island. This was "Charming Newport of Aquidneck,"
as the colonial histories recorded it, then a
leading seaport of New England. Thames Street,
fronting it, was, in the eighteenth century, one of the
busiest highways of America. Protecting the harbor
entrance, upon Brenton's Point, is Fort Adams, which
was a formidable fortification before modern-gunnery
improvements superseded the old systems, and,
next to Fortress Monroe, it is the largest defensive
work in the United States, having accommodations
for a garrison of three thousand men. It was built
during the Presidency of John Adams, and named
for him, being then hurried to completion as a defense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
against French attacks, war with that country
seeming to be imminent, and the French particularly
desiring to possess Newport. All around the ancient
town, and spreading over the plateau, to which the
surface slopes upward in gentle ascent from the harbor,
is the modern Newport of the American nineteenth
century multi-millionaires. From the older
town, southward across the plateau, stretches the
chief street, Bellevue Avenue, through the fashionable
residential district.</p>

<p>William Coddington, whose name is preserved in
various ways, but whose descendants are said to have
been degenerate, founded Newport. He led a band
of dissenters from the Puritan church in Massachusetts
and bought Aquidneck from the Indians, starting
his colony in 1639. Most of the earlier settlers,
in fact, were people of various religious sects driven
out of the strictly Puritan New England towns.
Having abandoned England because they objected to
a State Church, we are told that the Puritans forthwith
proceeded to set up in Massachusetts what was
very like a State Church of their own, and soon
made it hot for the unbelievers. They drove out
both William Blackstone and Roger Williams. Blackstone,
when he had to go over the border and establish
his hermitage at Study Hill on Blackstone River,
said: "I came from England because I did not like the
Lords Bishops, but I cannot join with you, because
I would not be under the Lords Brethren." After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Blackstone and Williams, many others came to Rhode
Island and settled at Newport, for there they enjoyed
the completest liberty of conscience. The Quakers
were unmolested and came in large numbers; the
Baptists flocked in and built a meeting-house; the
Hebrews came, solid business men, originally from
Portugal, and established the first synagogue in the
United States; the sternest doctrines of the Calvinists
were preached; the Moravians held their impressive
love-feasts; and orthodox Churchmen fervently
prayed for the English King. There were all shades
of belief, and dissenters of all ilks, and many having
no belief at all, so that the fair town on Aquidneck
was pervaded with such an atmosphere of religious
toleration and cosmopolitan irregularity that it became
famous for its sharp contrast with the stern
rigidity of New England. Hence it was not unnatural
that at the opening of the nineteenth century
President Dwight should have declared that an alleged
laxity of morals in Stonington was due to "its nearness
to Rhode Island." But despite these peculiarities
the Newport colony got on well, so that the
growing settlement on the "Isle of Peace" in time
came to be designated as the "Eden of America."
Dean Berkeley, afterwards Bishop, visited Newport
in 1729, remaining several years, and gave the colony
an elevated literary tone. An Utopian plan for converting
the Indians brought him over from England,
but he soon discovered that it was impracticable, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
went back home to become a Bishop. His favorite
resort is shown at the part of the Newport Cliffs
called the "Hanging Rocks," and it is said he there
composed his <i>Alciphron, or the Minute Philosopher</i>,
and the noble lyric closing with the famous verse proclaiming
the patriotic prophecy which Leutze made
the subject of his grand mural painting in the Capitol
at Washington:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Westward the course of empire takes its way."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="center p2">NEWPORT DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>Newport, before the Revolution, was a most important
seaport. When Dean Berkeley was there it
had about forty-five hundred inhabitants, and they
had grown to twelve thousand when the Revolution
began. The preceding half-century was the era of
its greatest maritime prosperity, when Newport ships
circumnavigated the globe. The salubrity of the
climate and advantages of the harbor providing safe
anchorage but a few miles from the ocean attracted
many merchants and a large trade, and in those days
the Quakers and the Hebrews were the leading citizens.
In 1770 Boston alone surpassed Newport in
the extent of its trade, which then was much greater
than that of New York. It was about this time that
a visitor to New York wrote back to the <i>Newport
Mercury</i> that "at its present rate of progress, New
York will soon be as large as Newport." The Revolutionary
War, however, almost ruined the town,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
and annihilated its commerce. The port was at first
held by the English, and afterwards by the French,
both battering and maltreating it, so that it emerged
from the conflict in a dilapidated condition, with the
population reduced to barely five thousand. The
French learned to love the attractive island, and
sought earnestly after the war to have it annexed
to France, in return for the aid given the Americans,
but Washington strongly opposed this and prevented
it. The trade was gone, never to return, the merchants
went away to Providence, New York and
Boston, and it existed in quiet and uneventful neglect
until the nineteenth century had made some
progress, when people began seeking its pleasant
shores for summer recreation. In 1840 two hotels
were built, and this began the <i>renaissance</i>. The
Civil War made vast fortunes, and their owners
sought Newport, and it has since become the great
summer home of the fashionable world of America,
where they can, in friendly rivalry, make the most
lavish displays possible for wealth to accomplish at a
seaside resort.</p>

<p>Unlike most American watering-places, Newport
is not an aggregation of hotels and lodging-houses,
but it is pre-eminently a gathering of the costliest
and most elaborate suburban homes this country can
show. Built upon the extensive space surrounding
the older town, and between it and the ocean, south
and east, modern Newport is a galaxy of large and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
expensive country-houses, each in an enclosure of
lawns, flower-gardens and foliage, highly ornamental
and exceedingly well kept. Many of them are spacious
palaces upon which enormous sums have been
expended; and in front of their lawns, for several
miles along the winding brow of the cliffs that fall off
precipitously to the ocean's edge, is laid the noted
"Cliff Walk." This is a narrow footpath at the
edge of the greensward that has the waves dashing
against the bases of the rocks supporting it, while inland,
beyond the lawns, are the noble palaces of Newport.
Each is a type of different architecture, and
no matter how grand and imposing, each is called a
"cottage." The greatest rivalry has been shown in
construction, and the styles cover all known methods
of building&mdash;Gothic, Elizabethan, Tudor, Swiss,
Flemish, French, with every sort of ancient house
in Britain or Continental Europe, imitated and improved
upon, and in some cases widely varying systems
being condensed together. Some of these
"cottages" have thus become piles of buildings,
with all sorts of porticos, doorways, pavilions, dormers,
oriels, bow-windows, bays and turrets, towers,
chimneys, gambrel roofs and gables, the whole being
charmingly elaborated into wide-spreading, imposing
and sometimes astonishing houses. Occasionally the
villa is elongated into the stable, in an extended
house, which includes the family, horses, hounds, domestics
and grooms, all living under the same roof.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
A low and rambling style of architecture, with many
gables and prominent colors, is the favorite for various
Newport cottages. To the southward of the town
are the Ocean Avenue and Ocean Drive, skirting the
whole lower coast of the island for some ten miles,
and displaying fine marine views.</p>

<p>There have been lavished upon these palaces of
Newport, in construction and decoration, large portions
of the greatest incomes of the multi-millionaires of
New York and Boston, and hither they hie to enjoy
the summer and early autumn in a sort of fashionable
semi-seclusion, mingling only in their own sets, and
rather resenting the excursions occasionally made by
the plebeian folk into Newport to look at their displays.
These princes of inherited wealth have made
Newport peculiarly their own, and, their expenditures
being on a scale commensurate with their millions,
the growth and improvement of the newer part of
the place have been extraordinary. Land in choice
locations is quoted above $50,000 an acre, and a
Newport "cottage" costs $500,000 to $1,000,000 to
build, with more for the furnishing. Once, when I
asked what was the qualification necessary to become
a director of one of the great banks of New York, I
was told that it was the ownership of ten shares of
stock and a cottage at Newport. The sense of newness
is sometimes impressive in gazing at these Aladdin
palaces, for while the architecture reproduces
quaint and ancient forms, the ancestral ivy does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
not yet cling to the walls, and the trees are still
young. But there are older sites in Newport, back
from the sea-front, where some of the estates, existing
many years, have smaller and more subdued
houses with signs of maturity, where the ivy broadly
spreads and the trees have grown. Some of the
foliage-embowered lanes, leading through the older
suburbs, are charming in leafy richness and make
scenes of exquisite rural beauty.</p>

<p>The Casino is the fashionable centre of Newport,
a building in Old English style, fronting on Bellevue
Avenue, having reading-rooms, a theatre, gardens
and tennis-court, and here the band plays in the
season, and there are concerts and balls. During the
fashionable period, Bellevue Avenue is the daily scene
of a stately procession of handsome equipages of all
styles, as it is decreed that the great people of Newport
shall always ride when on exhibition, and they
thus pass and repass in the afternoons in splendid review.
In the earlier times the town's chief benefactor
was Judah Touro, who gave it Touro Park. His
father was the rabbi of Newport synagogue, which
now has no congregation. Judah spent fifty years
in New Orleans amassing a fortune, which was bequeathed
to various charities. He also liberally aided
the fund for building Bunker Hill Monument. The
synagogue, with the beautiful garden adjacent, the
Jewish Cemetery, is maintained in perfect order.
Touro Park is a pretty enclosure in the older town,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
containing statues of Commodore M. C. Perry and
William Ellery Channing, who were natives of Newport,
and a statue of the former's brother, Commodore
Oliver H. Perry, the victor of Lake Erie, is also
at the City Hall, not far away. In Touro Park is
the great memorial around which the antiquarian
treasures of this famous place are clustered, the "Old
Stone Mill," a small round tower, overrun with ivy
and supported on pillars between which are arched
openings. Its origin is a mystery, and this is the
antiquarian shrine at which Newport worships.
Longfellow tells weirdly of it in his <i>Skeleton in Armor</i>,
and some of the wise men suggest that it was built
by the Norsemen when they first came this way and
found Vinland so long ago. But the more practical
townsfolk generally incline to the belief that an early
colonist put it up for a windmill to grind corn, the
weight of the evidence appearing to favor the theory
that it was erected by Governor Benedict Arnold, of
the colony, who died in 1678, and described it in his
will as "my stone-built wind-will." It is, however,
of sufficient antiquity and mystery to have a halo
cast around it, and is the great relic of the town.
The seacoast rocks that make the Newport Cliffs
show some wonderful formations of chasms and
spouting rocks. A fine fleet of yachts is usually in
Newport water, and it is a favorite naval rendezvous,
having the Training Station, War College and Torpedo
Station, and a new Naval Hospital. This most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
famous of American seaside watering-places has a
permanent population approximating twenty-five
thousand, considerably increased by the summer
visitors.</p>

<p class="center p2">NEW BEDFORD.</p>

<p>To the eastward of Narragansett another bay is
thrust far up into the land of Massachusetts, Buzzard's
Bay, which almost bisects the great defensive
forearm of Massachusetts, Cape Cod. This bay is
thirty miles long and about seven miles wide. Between
it and Narragansett are the tree-clad hills of
the sparsely-settled regions which the Indians called
Aponigansett and Acoaksett, out of which the Acushnet
River runs down to its broadening estuary, now
the harbor of New Bedford. Originally this city was
peopled by Quakers of the English Russell family,
of which the Duke of Bedford is the head, so that
the colony was named from his title. A numerous
Portuguese migration to the early settlements has
caused one of the suburbs to still retain the name of
Fayal. New Bedford stretches two miles along the
western river-bank and far back upon the gradually
ascending surface, and the population, including the
opposite suburb of Fairhaven, numbers seventy
thousand. Early a shipping port, it grew into
celebrity with the advance of the whale fishery,
which became its chief industry, and it was then
said to be the wealthiest city in the country in proportion
to population, having in 1854 four hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
and ten whaling ships, with ten thousand sailors, its
fleets patrolling the remotest seas. When this fishery
died out, the people went to manufacturing, and
now they have numerous large mills busily spinning
cotton, its noted product being the Wamsutta muslins.
There still remain a few of the little bluff-bowed and
flush-decked old whalers rotting at the wharves, with
huge overhanging davits, and still redolent of oil&mdash;the
relics of an almost obsolete industry. The ample fortunes
originally gathered in the fishery enabled the
marine aristocracy of the town to build their stately
and comfortable old mansions which now enjoy an
honorable repose in ample grounds along the quiet
streets on the higher plateau back from the river.</p>

<p>When Samuel de Champlain came into the St.
Lawrence River, he wrote that whales were killed
by firing cannon-balls at them, and later explorers
described how the Indians captured them. The colonists
early began the fishery along the New England
coasts, and New Bedford sent out its first ships in
1755. The period of greatest success in whaling
was between 1820 and 1857. The advent of gas
and petroleum, financial reverses, the gradual extermination
of the whales, which had been pursued to
the remotest regions, the substitution of steel for
whalebone, and the use of hard rubber, all contributed
to the decline of the business, and it was given
its death-blow by the ravages of the Confederate
privateers among the Pacific whaling fleets. Its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
memory is kept alive, however, by many romances
of the sea, it having furnished an extensive and
interesting literature. Not long ago it was related
that the unfortunate sculptor who had carved
the figure-heads for the whaleships was since compelled
to earn a precarious livelihood by chopping
out rude wooden idols for the South Sea islanders.
Acushnet River is dammed in its upper waters, making
an immense reservoir, furnishing power to the
extensive mills. The harbor gradually broadens as it
opens into Buzzard's Bay, and Clark's Point stretches
far into the bay, having on the extremity an old-time
square stone fort, with bastions at the corners,
formerly the trusted defender of the harbor and the
town, Fort Taber. Now, its only use is to furnish,
on the outer corner, a foundation for a lighthouse
lantern. The whaling fleet it formerly guided is all
gone, but now it is the beacon for an enormous trade
in coal, landed here for distribution by railway
throughout New England. Another little stone fort
is also built on the opposite side of the harbor, on a
rock at the lower end of Fairhaven. Outside is the
broad surface of the bay, a noble inland sea, with irregular
and generally thinly populated shores, but
with attractions that have drawn to it, in various
localities, a large summer population, with many ornate
villas of modern fashion. Just below Clark's
Point is villa-studded Nonquitt, upon an upland
among the undulating hills, where lived General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Philip Sheridan, and to which he was brought home
in a United States warship to die, in July, 1888.
They tell us that when the venturesome Norsemen
came along here, the bay was given the name of the
Straum Fiord, but the antiquary is at a loss to find a
satisfactory derivation for the present name of Buzzard's
Bay. Far over its waters, as seen from
Clark's Point, is the low, dark, gray forest-clad eastern
shore, stretching down to the distant strait of
Wood's Holl, leading out of the bay into Vineyard
Sound. Spread across the bay entrance to the southward,
and protecting it from the open sea, are the
Elizabeth Islands.</p>

<p class="center p2">VINEYARD SOUND.</p>

<p>After Captain Bartholomew Grosnold had discovered
Cape Cod in May, 1602, he coasted along its
shores, and coming down into what is known as
Vineyard Sound, found himself in an archipelago of
islands. He halted at the one called "No Man's
Land," and gave it the name of Martha's Vineyard,
which is now applied to the largest of these islands.
Who his favorite Martha was, and why she should
have been immortalized, old Bartholomew never told,
thus disappointing many industrious people who have
vainly sought the lady's personal history. "The
Vineyard," as it is familiarly called, lies southeast of
Buzzard's Bay, across which is the extended and
narrow range of the Elizabeth Islands, trending far
away to the southwestward, and ending with Cuttyhunk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
where the first English spade was driven into
New England soil. It was upon this, the outermost
island, that Gosnold landed and planted his colony,
naming it Elizabeth, in honor of his queen, a title
afterwards given the entire range. The island had a
pond in which was a rocky islet, and here, as they
feared the Indians, the colonists built a fort and resided
while they gathered a cargo of sassafras for
their ship, that being then a much-prized specific in
Europe. The settlement was brief; frightened by
savage threats and rent by quarrels, they soon abandoned
the place, loading their ship and returning to
England disheartened. This settlement antedated
by eighteen years the arrival of the "Mayflower"
at Plymouth.</p>

<p>The Elizabeth group is a range of sixteen islands,
stretching in a long line from the Cape Cod shore for
eighteen miles southwest to the extremity of Cuttyhunk.
It makes the southeastern boundary of Buzzard's
Bay, with Martha's Vineyard beyond, there
being between them the long and rather narrow channel
of Vineyard Sound. The mariner going eastward
out of Long Island Sound passes Sakonnet
Point at the eastern verge of Narragansett Bay, and
finds in front a chain of beacons posted across the
route. Two of these are lightships, marking reefs to
which are given the bucolic names of the "Hen and
Chickens" and the "Sow and Pigs." If the shipmaster
wishes to enter Buzzard's Bay for New Bedford,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
he sails between these two unromantic shoals,
passing a lightship on either hand, and being further
guided by a lighthouse on the extremity of Cuttyhunk.
But if he wishes to follow the great maritime
route to the eastward around Cape Cod, he gives the
"Sow and Pigs" a wide berth to the northward and
passes between it and the splendid flashing red and
white beacon on Gay Head, the western extremity
of Martha's Vineyard, south of Cuttyhunk. Gosnold
was the first Englishman who saw the brilliant
and variegated coloring of this remarkable promontory
when the sun shone upon it, and appropriately
called it the Gay Head. Its magnificent Fresnel
lens, the most powerful in this region, is elevated one
hundred and seventy feet above the sea, and is thirty
miles east of Point Judith. The breadth of the entrance
to Vineyard Sound from this lighthouse across
to the lightship is about seven miles.</p>

<p>The northeastern extremity of the Elizabeth
Islands is Naushon, and between it and the main
land of Cape Cod are the strait and harbor formerly
known to the sailor as Wood's Hole, but now refined
into Wood's Holl, just as "Holmes's Hole," another
popular harbor over on "the Vineyard," has since
become Vineyard Haven. Both of these "holes,"
and particularly the latter, have always been favorite
places for schooner skippers to run into and avoid
adverse winds. The Elizabeth group has four large
islands, the others being small. Narrow and often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
tortuous channels separate them. Cuttyhunk is about
two and one-half miles long, and the present successor
of Gosnold's ill-starred colony is a club from New
York who have a seaside establishment there. Not
far away, to the northward, is Penikese Island, covering
about one hundred acres, which was formerly
the location of Professor Agassiz's "Summer School
of Natural History." East of Cuttyhunk is Nashawena,
three miles long, and next comes Pasque
Island, also the abiding-place of an attractive club
comfortably housed. Naushon is the largest island,
eight miles long, stretching from Pasque almost to
Wood's Holl, and having opposite each other, on its
northern and southern shores, two noted harbors of
refuge, the Kettle and Tarpaulin Coves. Upon
Naushon, early in the nineteenth century, lived
James Bowdoin, the diplomatist and benefactor of
Bowdoin College in Maine, which was named for his
father. Naushon is a very pretty island, and was described
in those days by a distinguished English lady
traveller as "a little pocket America, a liliputian
Western world, a compressed Columbia." Clustering
around its northeastern extremity are some of
the smaller islets of the group&mdash;the Ram Islands,
and Wepecket, Uncatina and Nonamesset. The strait
at Wood's Holl forms a rocky gateway leading from
Buzzard's Bay into Vineyard Sound, and just beyond,
on the Cape Cod shore, is its guiding beacon on the
point of Nobska Hill. Wood's Holl has but a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
harbor on the edge of the contracted and tortuous
passage, which is full of rocks, difficult to navigate,
and generally having the tide running through like a
millrace. The settlement is small, displaying attractive
cottages on the adjacent shores, and here are
located the station and buildings of the United States
Fish Commission and the Marine Biological Laboratory.</p>

<p class="center p2">MARTHA'S VINEYARD.</p>

<p>Between the Elizabeth Islands and Martha's Vineyard
is the great route of vessels passing to and from
New England waters, and the lighthouse keeper at
the entrance has counted more than a thousand of
them passing in a single week. Aquatic birds skim
the waters, and all about the Sound are islands great
and small, their granite coasts contrasting with the
blue waters they protect from the severity of ocean
storms. A tale is told of the origin of the names of
some of the islands, which is original, if apocryphal.
The story comes as a tradition from the "oldest inhabitant"
of these parts, who is said to have been
the owner of all these islands, and who determined,
before he died, to bestow the chief ones upon his four
favorite daughters. Accordingly, Rhoda took Rhode
Island; Elizabeth took hers; Martha was given
"the Vineyard;" and there was left for Nancy the
remaining large island&mdash;so "Nan-took-it."</p>

<p>Martha's Vineyard is shaped much like a triangle,
and is twenty-three miles long and about ten miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
broad in the widest part. Vineyard Haven, its chief
harbor, is deep and narrow, opening like a pair of
jaws at the northern apex of the triangle, the entrance
being guarded by the pointed peninsulas of
the East Chop and West Chop, each provided with a
lighthouse. Within is one of the most fairly constructed
natural harbors ever seen, a spacious haven
of protection, often crowded with vessels, which run
in there to escape rough treatment outside. Here is
the pleasant village of Vineyard Haven, prettily located
upon the sloping banks of a small cove inside,
and having down at the end of the harbor a Government
Marine Hospital. "The Vineyard's" famous
western promontory of Gay Head is composed of
ponderous cliffs, falling off steeply to the water, and
presents an interesting geological study. The inclined
strata rise about two hundred feet above the
sea, being gaily colored in tints of red, white, yellow,
green, and black. About forty-five hundred people
reside on this island, including fishermen, sailors and
farmers, but mostly gaining a livelihood by ministering
to the wants of the large population of summer
visitors. The first colonist was Thomas Mayhew, a
Puritan from Southampton, who came in 1642, being
then the grantee both of Martha's Vineyard and
Nantucket.</p>

<p>Cottage City is the chief settlement, built upon the
eastern ocean shore of "the Vineyard," a wonderful
place attracting twenty to thirty thousand people in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
the summer. The bluff shore rises precipitously for
thirty feet from the narrow beach forming the verge
of the sea, and there are myriads of cottages, many
hotels, and a complete summer town spreading over
a large surface. Here are held the great Camp
Meetings which are the attraction in August&mdash;one
Methodist and the other Baptist. The former is the
"Martha's Vineyard Camp Meeting Association," first
established and meeting in the Wesleyan Grove, back
from the sea. The other is the "Oak Bluffs Association,"
out by the ocean's edge. This place, thoroughly
alive in summer, is dormant, however, for nearly nine
months of the year. From it a railroad runs several
miles southward along the shore to the little village
of Edgartown, the place of original colonization, and
the county-seat of Dukes County, Massachusetts,
which is composed of all these islands. Towards the
southeast, out of sight, is the distant island of Nantucket.
Nearer is seen the misty outline of old Chappaquadick
Island, called "the Old Chap," for short,
with its long terminating extremity of Cape Poge.
To the northward is the hazy mainland of Cape Cod,
a streak upon the horizon, whence, long ago, these
islands are supposed to have been sliced off during the
glacial epoch, and going adrift, were thus anchored
out in the ocean.</p>

<p class="center p2">NANTUCKET.</p>

<p>The island of Nantucket, dropped in the Atlantic,
everyone has heard of, but few visit. We are told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
by tradition that it was originally formed by the
mythical Indian giant, Manshope, who, when he was
tired of smoking, emptied here into the sea the ashes
from his pipe. It was also the smoke from this pipe
which created the fogs so plentifully abounding
around the place. These fogs are very dense, and it
is said of a certain noted Nantucket skipper going
away on a long voyage that he marked one of them
with his harpoon, and returning to the harbor three
years later, at once recognized the same fog by his
private mark. Old Manshope, the giant, was the
tutelary genius of all the Indian tribes on the islands
of Vineyard Sound and the adjacent mainland, and
his home was on the cliffs of Gay Head, in an ancient
extinct volcanic crater, now called the Devil's
Den. He feasted here on the flesh of whales, which
he broiled on live coals, obtaining fuel by uprooting
huge trees. His firelight, thus made, is said to have
been the earliest beacon seen by superstitious sailors
passing the headland, and as it flickered in his midnight
orgies, they solemnly shook their heads, saying,
"Old Manshope is at it again." This powerful giant
seems to have waded around Vineyard and Nantucket
Sounds and regulated all the affairs of the neighborhood.
But finally the sailors and colonists became so
numerous that he waxed very wroth. With a single
stroke of his ponderous club he separated "No Man's
Land" from "the Vineyard," and then transformed his
children into fishes. His wife lamented this cruelty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
and he seized and threw her over to the mainland on
Sakonnet Point, where she still lies, a misshapen
rock. Then the disgusted giant vanished forever.</p>

<p>The Norsemen first named the island Nautikon, appropriately
meaning the "Far Away Land." From this,
on an early map, it appears as Natocko, then as Nantukes,
and finally it became Nantucquet, from which the
present name is derived. When Gosnold came along
in 1602, he first saw its great eastern promontory, Sankaty
Head, describing the island as covered with oak
trees and populous with Indians. After the original
grant was made to Thomas Mayhew, he sold it in
1659 to the "ten original purchasers" for £30 and
two beaver hats, one for himself and one for his wife,
he reserving one-tenth. These purchasers colonized
the island, Thomas Macy, a Quaker who fled from
Puritan persecution in New England, beginning the
first settlement, and Peter Foulger, who came there
somewhat later, had a daughter, who was the mother
of Benjamin Franklin. John G. Whittier, the good
Quaker poet, thus sings of Macy's flight to the island:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Far round the bleak and stormy cape</p>
<p class="i1">The vent'rous Macy passed,</p>
<p>And on Nantucket's naked isle</p>
<p class="i1">Drew up his boat at last."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Macy landed at the site of the town of Nantucket,
then the Indian village of Wesco, or the "White
Stone," which lay on the shore of the harbor, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
afterwards had a wharf built over it. The whale
fishery, which made Nantucket's prosperity, began
early, in boats from the island, and the population
had increased by the Revolution to about forty-five
hundred, Sherburne, as it then was called, being the
chief whaling port in the world, with one hundred
and fifty whale ships. The island was covered with
trees, but they were all destroyed during the Revolution,
and it was then made almost a desert, losing
also the greater part of its population and much of
the fishery fleet. There was a revival subsequently,
and Nantucket reached its maximum prosperity in
1840, with nearly ten thousand population. Afterwards
came the final decline of whaling, and the
sandy, almost treeless island now has about three
thousand people, who depend for a living chiefly on
the summer visitors. It is without a whaleship, but
it has many snug cottages, and those going for
health and rest can well say, with Whittier:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"God bless the sea-beat island!</p>
<p class="i1">And grant forever more</p>
<p>That charity and freedom dwell,</p>
<p class="i1">As now, upon her shore."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Nantucket is southeast of Martha's Vineyard and
south of Cape Cod, the sea between them being
known as Nantucket Sound. The island is an irregular
spherical triangle, sixteen miles long and three
to four miles wide, the outer coast bent around like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
a bow, as the Gulf Stream currents wash the shores.
To the south and east are the great Nantucket
Shoals, dangerous to the navigator, but acting as a
breakwater, preventing the island being entirely
washed away by the sea, which makes constant encroachments.
The harbor of Nantucket town presents
sandy beaches and bluff shores, rising with
some boldness from the water, the sand dunes stretching
away in regular lines behind them. The town
is snugly located at the bottom of a deep and secure
harbor, having a breakwater outside, and its chief
daily event is the arrival of the steamboat from the
mainland, from which it is frequently cut off for days
together by winter ice and stormy weather. There
are various ancient and dilapidated wharves, fronting
a collection of strange-looking old gabled houses,
many having raised platforms on top of the peaked
roofs, where the former inhabitants used to go up to
watch for vessels. It is a healthy place, with modern
hotels, tree-lined, pleasant streets, many gardens, and
a magnificent climate, the winter rigors corrected by
the closeness of the Gulf Stream. The surrounding
country, outside the town, is almost everywhere a
flat prairie-land, with the one horizon all around, of
the distant blue sea. A narrow-gauge railroad leads
over to the southeastern coast at Siasconset, the
quaint original gem of the island, familiarly called
'Sconset, a curious little village of fishermen's huts,
existing now about the same as in the primitive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
days. Its outlook is over the South Shoals, but not
a sail is to be seen, for these shoals are the grave of
every vessel getting upon them. It is a dismal reminder
of vanished maritime prestige to see about
the Nantucket coasts the gaunt ribs of the old hulks,
half sunken in the sands where they have been cast
ashore, as year by year they gradually break up in
the great storms and slowly disappear. In the Boston
<i>Daily Advertiser</i> a poet plaintively mourns the
fate of these marine skeletons seen "at midnight off
the coast":</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Half-tombed in drifting sands upon the shore</p>
<p class="i1">Are ye, and heedless lashed by angry seas,</p>
<p class="i1">As through your blackened ribs the breeze</p>
<p>Exultant plays, and crested breakers roar,</p>
<p>And screeching sea-gulls round thee, prostrate, soar.</p>
<p class="i1">Wert thou allured by sighs of moaning trees,</p>
<p class="i1">As sirens sought to charm with songs like these</p>
<p>Ulysses and his brave companions o'er</p>
<p>To reefs deep hidden, silent, save in storm?</p>
<p class="i1">The rolling thunder of the sullen surge,</p>
<p class="i2">The mournful sobbing of the gathering gale,</p>
<p>Plain answer make, as round the spectre form</p>
<p class="i1">Of these gaunt skeletons they ceaseless scourge</p>
<p class="i2">The giant's battered coat of oaken mail!"</p>

<p class="center p2">THE LONG TIDAL RIVER.</p>

<p>The greatest New England river, the Connecticut,
was first explored by the redoubtable Dutch navigator,
Captain Adraien Blok. When he made his
memorable voyage of discovery from New Amsterdam
along Long Island Sound, Blok ascended the
Connecticut to Enfield Falls. Its source is in the
highlands of northern New Hampshire upon the
Canadian boundary, at an elevation of twenty-five
hundred feet, and it flows four hundred and fifty
miles southward to the Sound. Its Indian title was
Quonektakat, or "the long tidal river," from which
the name has been derived. It is noted for beautiful
scenery and has many cataracts, the chief being Olcott
Falls, at Wilder in Vermont, South Hadley in
Massachusetts, and Enfield in Connecticut. The soils
of its valley are extremely fertile, making a garden-spot
in the otherwise generally sterile New England,
the most luxuriant crop being the tobacco-plant,
known as "Connecticut seed-leaf," used largely for
cigar-wrappers, and often yielding two thousand
pounds to the acre. Steamboats navigate the river
to Hartford, about fifty miles from the Sound. The
blazing red beacon of the Cornfield Point Lightship
is the outer guide for the mariner entering its mouth,
while the white lights of Saybrook guard the inner
channel. The lower Connecticut flows through a region
of farms, enriched by copious dressings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
manures made from the fish caught in the stream,
and it passes picturesque shores and pleasant villages
in the domain of Haddam, an extensive tract which
the Indians originally sold to Hartford people for
thirty coats.</p>

<p>Middletown, the "Forest City," at a great bend in
the lower river, has many mills making pumps, tapes,
plated wares, webbing and sewing-machines, its
shaded streets leading up the hill-slopes, bordering
the water, that have in them valuable quarries of
rich brown Portland stone. The county Court-house
of Middletown is a quaint little miniature of the Parthenon.
The Wesleyan Methodist College, having
three hundred students, is located here, the chief
buildings being the Memorial and Judd Halls, built
of the native Portland stone, the latter the gift of
Orange Judd. The large buildings of the Connecticut
Insane Hospital, also of Portland stone, overlook
the river from a high hill southeast of the city, and
are in a spacious park. To the northward of Middletown,
level green and exceedingly fertile meadows
adjoin the river, their product being the noted onion
crops of Wethersfield, which permeate the whole
country. This was the earliest Connecticut settlement
in 1635, and here in the next year convened
the first Connecticut Legislature to make the arrangements
for the war against the Pequots which annihilated
that tribe. In one of its old mansions General
Washington had his headquarters, where, in conjunction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
with the French officers, the plans were prepared
for the campaign closing the Revolution by the
victory at Yorktown.</p>

<p>To the westward of the river are the famous
"Blue Hills of Southington," the most elevated portion
of the State of Connecticut, and nestling under
their shadow is Meriden, the hills rising high above
its western and northern verge, in the West Peak
and Mount Lamentation. Here are gathered over
thirty thousand people in an active factory town, the
neat wooden dwellings of the operatives forming the
nucleus of the city adjacent to the extensive mills,
and having as a surrounding galaxy the attractive
villas of their owners, scattered in pleasant places
upon the steep adjacent hills. They are industrious
iron and steel, bronze, brass and tin workers, and the
Meriden Britannia and electro-plated silver wares are
famous everywhere. The Meriden Britannia Company
has enormous mills, and is the greatest establishment
of its kind in the world. Meriden and
Berlin, a short distance northward, have long been
the headquarters of the peripatetic Connecticut tin-pedler,
who goes forth laden with all kinds of pots
and pans, and other bright and useful utensils, to
wander over the land, and charm the country folk
with his attractive bargains. Berlin began in the
eighteenth century the first American manufacture
of tinware. There are scores of villages about, cast
almost in the same mould. Each has the same beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
central Public Green, the charm of the New
England village, shaded by rows of stately elms; the
tall-spired churches; the village graveyard, usually
on a gently-sloping hillside, with the lines of older
white gravestones, supplemented in the modern interments
by more elaborate monuments; the attractive
wooden houses nestling amid abundant foliage, and
surrounded by gardens and flower-beds, that are the
homes of the people, and the huge factories giving
them employment. Some of these villages are larger
than others, thus covering more space, but excepting
in size, all are substantially alike.</p>

<p class="center p2">HARTFORD.</p>

<p>The high gilded dome of the Capitol at Hartford
and the broad fronts of the stately buildings
of Trinity College surmounting Rocky Hill, above
a labyrinth of factories, are seen rising on the
Connecticut River bank to the northward. This is
the noted city, with about seventy thousand people,
which has reproduced in New England the name in
the mother country of the ancient Saxon village just
north of London at the "Ford of Harts," whence
some of its early settlers came. The brave and
pious Thomas Hooker led his flock from the seacoast
through the wilderness in 1636 to Hartford, to establish
an English colony at the Indian post of Suckiang,
the Dutch three years before having built a fort and
trading-station at a bend of the Connecticut, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
the little Park River flowing in gave a water-power
which turned the wheels of a small grist-mill, to
which all the country around afterwards brought
grain to be ground. Cotton Mather, the quaint historian,
described Hooker as "the renowned minister
of Hartford and pillar of Connecticut, and the light
of the Western churches." Hartford is known as the
"Queen City," and its centre is the attractive Bushnell
Park, fronting on the narrow and winding Park
River. An airy bridge leads from the railway station
over this little stream, to the tasteful Park entrance,
a triumphal brownstone arch with surmounting
conical towers, erected as a memorial to the
soldiers who fell in the Civil War. A grand highway
then continues up the hill to the Connecticut
State Capitol, which cost $2,500,000 to build, one of
the finest structures in New England, an imposing
Gothic temple of white marble, three hundred feet
long, the dome rising two hundred and fifty feet, and
all the fronts elaborately ornamented with statuary
and artistic decoration. The statue of General Putnam,
who died at Hartford in 1790, is in the Park,
and his tombstone, battered and weatherworn, is
kept as a precious relic in the Capitol. The "Putnam
Phalanx" is the great military organization of
Hartford. In the east wing of the Capitol is the
bronze statue of Nathan Hale, whom the British
hanged as a spy in the Revolution. It is a masterpiece,
the almost living figure seeming animated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
the full vigor of earnest youth, as with outstretched
hands he actually appears to speak his memorable
words: "I only regret that I have but one life to
lose for my country." The Connecticut law-makers
of to-day who meet in this sumptuous Capitol are
milder legislators than their ancestors who made the
"blue laws" of the olden time, when the iron rule
of the Puritan pastors governing the colony enacted
a Draconian code, inflicting death penalties for the
crimes of idolatry, unchastity, blasphemy, witchcraft,
murder, man-stealing, smiting parents, and some
others, with savage punishment for Sabbath-breaking
and the use of tobacco.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>State Capitol, Hartford, Conn.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The celebrated Charter Oak is the great memory
of Hartford. In 1856 the old tree was blown down
in a storm, and a marble slab marks where it stood.
The remains of the tree were fashioned into many
precious relics, and our friend of humorous memory,
Mark Twain, who lives in Hartford, says he has
seen all conceivable articles made out of this precious
timber, there being, among others, "a walking-stick,
dog-collar, needle-case, three-legged stool, bootjack,
dinner-table, tenpin alley, toothpick, and enough
Charter Oak to build a plank-road from Hartford to
Great Salt Lake City." This ancient tree concealed
the royal charter of the Connecticut colony, granted
by the King, when, in 1687, the tyrannical Governor
Andros came to Hartford with his troops and
demanded its surrender. While the subject was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
being discussed in the Legislature, the lights were
suddenly put out, and in the darkness a bold colonist
seized the precious document, and running out, concealed
it in the hollow of the oak. The fine statue
surmounting the Capitol dome and overlooking the
city is now, with extended arm, crowning the municipality
with a wreath of Charter Oak leaves, and the
oak leaf is repeated in many ways in the decoration
of the Capitol and of many other buildings in the
city. The Charter Oak Bank and Life Insurance
Company are also flourishing institutions. In proportion
to population, Hartford is regarded as the
wealthiest city in America, and it is financially great,
particularly in Life and Fire Insurance Companies,
whose business is wide-spread. It has many charitable
foundations, book-publishing houses, banks,
manufacturing establishments and educational institutions,
the most noted of the latter being Trinity
College, in the southern part of the city, its brownstone
Early English buildings having a grand view
across the intervening valley to the hills of Farmington
and Talcott Mountain, nine miles westward.</p>

<p>Picturesque suburbs adorned by magnificent villas
environ the built-up parts of Hartford, making a
splendid semi-rural residential section, where arching
elms embower the lawn-bordered avenues, many
localities being adorned by superb hedges. There
is a fine artistic and historical collection in the
Wadsworth Atheneum, where, among other precious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
relics, are kept General Putnam's sword and the
Indian King Philip's club. Mrs. Harriet Beecher
Stowe, and Mrs. Sigourney, the poetess, were long
residents of Hartford. The citizen whom it holds
in steadfast memory, however, is Colonel Samuel
Colt, who invented the revolving pistol. He was
born in Hartford, and his remains rest under a fine
monument in Cedar Hill Cemetery. His widow
built as his memorial a beautiful little brownstone
chapel, the Church of the Good Shepherd, which is
not far away from the huge works of the Colt Arms
Company, the chief industrial establishment of the
city. Colt, when a boy, ran away from home and
went to sea, and is said to have there conceived
the idea of his great invention. He sought vainly
during several years to establish a factory to make
it, but did not prosper until 1852, when he started
in Hartford; and with the great demand for small-arms
then stimulated by the opening of the California
gold mines and the exploration of the Western
plains, afterwards expanded by the Civil War,
his factory grew enormously. The heraldic "colt
rampant" adopted by the inventor is stamped on
all the arms and reproduced in all the decorations
of these vast works. Among other large factories
is also the Pope bicycle works. A short distance
west of Hartford is New Britain, where there are
twenty thousand people engaged in making hardware,
locks and jewelry, its noted resident having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
been Elihu Burritt, the "Learned Blacksmith," who
was born there in 1810 and died in 1879.</p>

<p class="center p2">SPRINGFIELD AND THE ARMORY.</p>

<p>To the north of Hartford is a fertile intervale, the
rich meadows of Mattaneag, where the Connecticut
River pours down the Enfield Rapids, and the diverted
water flows through a canal formerly used to
take the river-craft around the obstruction, but now
giving ample power to many paper and other mills
at Windsor Locks. The original colony was started
here by John Warham, said to have been the first
New England pastor who used notes in preaching.
He sustained the "blue laws," but his colony to-day
is a great tobacco-growing section, through which the
Farmington River flows down from the western
hills. At South Windsor, John Fitch, the steamboat
inventor, was born. The Hazardville Powder Works,
one of the greatest gunpowder factories in the world,
are beyond, and also Thompsonville, a prodigious
maker of carpets, and then the boundary is crossed
into Massachusetts. Just north of the line, the Connecticut
River sweeps grandly around in approaching
Springfield, built on the eastern bank, and
spreading for a long distance up the slopes of the
adjacent hills. It is a busy manufacturing city, with
sixty thousand population and an important railway
junction, where the roads along the river cross the
route from Boston to Albany and the West. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
was the Indian land of Agawam&mdash;"fish-abounding"&mdash;to
which the Puritan missionary William Pynchon
led his hardy flock in 1636, and the statue of Miles
Morgan, a noted soldier of the early time, representing
the "Puritan," stands, matchlock in hand, in
heroic bronze on the Public Square. Springfield is
noted for its great firearms factories, having the extensive
works of the Smith &amp; Wesson Company, and
also the United States Armory. This enormous
Government factory, making rifles for the army
previously on a large scale, quadrupled its output
during the Spanish War of 1898. It occupies an
extensive enclosure on Armory Hill, up to which the
surface gradually slopes from the river, giving an
admirable view over the city. The chief buildings
stand around a quadrangle, making a pleasant stretch
of lawn, with regular rows of trees crossing it.
There are a few old cannon planted about, giving a
military air, and here are made the Springfield rifles.
During the Revolution most of the arms for the
American army were made here, and the cannon
were cast that helped defeat Burgoyne at Saratoga.
In the Civil War the main works were constructed,
and they ran day and night for four years, making
nearly eight hundred thousand rifles for the Union
armies. The Arsenal, a large building on the western

twenty-five thousand arms, tastefully arranged, and

<p>At Springfield the Agawam River flows from the
westward into the Connecticut, and along its broad
bordering meadows comes the Boston and Albany
Railroad. This is one of the Vanderbilt lines, crossing
Massachusetts from the Berkshires to Boston, and
it was among the earliest railways built in New England,
being in construction from 1833 to 1842. The
project while zealously pushed was then generally derided
as chimerical, the Boston <i>Courier</i> of that time
saying the road could only be built at "an expense
of little less than the market value of the whole territory
of Massachusetts, and, if practicable, every
person of common sense knows it would be as useless
as a railroad from Boston to the moon." Yet it was
built, and prospered so much that, to break its profitable
monopoly, Massachusetts had afterwards to bore
the costly Hoosac Tunnel on the only available route,
to provide a competing line. The railroad climbs up
the Taghkanic range from the Hudson River Valley,
crosses the Berkshire Hills, going through Pittsfield
and over Hoosac Mountain at an elevation of fourteen
hundred and fifty feet, then coming down a wild
and picturesque defile made by a mountain brook
flowing into Westfield River, which in turn flows into
the Agawam. It is a route of magnificent scenery,
gradually leading from a mountain gorge to a broadening
intervale, where it passes the fertile Indian
domain of Woronoco and the pleasant town of Westfield,
noted for its whips and cigars. Then the winding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
reaches of the Agawam lead through broad
meadows and past many mills to Springfield. The
various streams around the Armory City, like so
much of the clear waters elsewhere in Massachusetts,
are largely devoted to paper-making, and eastward
from Springfield the railroad ascends the valley of the
swift-flowing Chicopee, meaning the "large spring,"
among more paper-mills. This is a vast industry
developed by the pure, clean waters of Central Massachusetts.
Farther eastward, however, the character
of the mills changes, and at Brookfield shoemaking
villages appear, while elsewhere there are textile and
leather factories. Brookfield was the birthplace, in
1818, of the noted female agitator Lucy Stone, its
Quaboag Pond furnishing the water turning the mill-wheels,
and then flowing off through Podunk meadows
by the Sashaway River to the Chicopee. At Spencer,
not far away, was born in 1819 Elias Howe, the inventor
of the sewing-machine. Farther eastward
the railway route leads to Worcester, and thence to
Boston.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE LAND OF NONOTUCK.</p>

<p>The valley of the Connecticut north of Springfield
is a hive of busy industries where are made most of
the finer papers used in the United States. All the
tributary water-courses teem with factories. Four
miles above Springfield the Chicopee flows in from
the eastern hills, there being a population of twenty
thousand, and the mills, served by the power from its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
falls two miles eastward, working cotton and wool,
brass and bronze, as well as making paper. Chicopee
Falls was the home of Edward Bellamy, author
of <i>Looking Backward</i>, who died in 1898. A few miles
above the Chicopee, on the Connecticut, are the
Hadley Falls, the greatest water-power of New England,
and the creator of Holyoke, with fifty thousand
people, the chief manufactory of fine papers in the
world. In a little more than a mile the river descends
sixty feet in falls and rapids, and by a system of
canals the water is led for three miles along the
banks, thus serving the factories, which have great
advantages of position, as the river winds around
them on three sides, and its flow is also supplemented
by steam-power. The water, from its great descent,
is used several times over. The main Hadley fall
descends thirty feet, and to prevent erosion is aproned
with stout timbers sheathed with boiler iron. The
river is bridled by a huge dam one thousand feet
long, and has a boom to catch the floating logs.</p>

<p>The scenery above the Hadley Falls grows more
attractive; the hills approach nearer the river and
rise sharply into mountains; the river winds about
their bases, and, abruptly turning, goes through a
gorge between them. Upon the western side is the
Mount Tom range, and upon the eastern bank Mount
Holyoke, with inclined-plane railways ascending
both, Mount Tom rising twelve hundred and fifteen
feet, and Mount Holyoke nine hundred and fifty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
feet. The Connecticut flows out between them from
the extensive valley above. These guardian peaks
of Tom and Holyoke bear the names of two pioneers
of the valley, who are said to have first discovered
the pass, and the tradition is that the broad and fertile
plain above, spreading almost to the northern Massachusetts
boundary, was once a lake with the outlet
towards the west, behind Mount Tom, until the waters
broke a passage through the ridge, and made the
Connecticut River route to the Sound. The origin
of these mountains was evidently volcanic, being
built up of trap-rock lifting its columned masses abruptly
from the level floor of the valley, and almost
without foothills to dwarf the greater elevation. The
broad vale beyond is the fertile land of Nonotuck,
bought from the Indians in 1653 for "one hundred
fathoms of wampum and ten coats." Here to the
westward of the river is Northampton, a most lovely
and attractive town, well described as "the frontispiece
of the book of beauty which Nature opens wide
in the valley of the Connecticut." The fairest fields
surround it, with thrifty farmers cultivating their
rich bottom-lands, and the people have a splendid
outlook in front of their doors, in the glorious panorama
of the noble mountains, with the river flowing
away through the deep gorge. The place was named
Northampton because most of the original settlers
came from that English town. Solomon Stoddart was
the sturdy Puritan pastor, ruling the flock at Nonotuck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
for over a half-century, the village being for
protection surrounded by a palisade and wall. The
little church in which he preached measured eighteen
by twenty-six feet, being built in 1655 at a cost of
$75, and the congregation were summoned to meeting
armed and by the blasts of a trumpet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Each man equipped on Sunday morn</p>
<p>With psalm-book, shot and powder-horn,</p>
<p>And looked in form, as all must grant,</p>
<p>Like th' ancient, true Church militant."</p>
</div></div>

<p>This renowned pastor was of majestic appearance,
and as good a fighter as he was a preacher. He
never hesitated to lead his people in their Indian
wars, and once he is said to have got into an ambush,
but the awestruck savages, impressed by his
noble bearing, hesitated to shoot him, telling their
French allies, "That is the Englishman's god."
The present stone church is the fifth built on the
original site. During nearly a quarter-century the
noted Jonathan Edwards was the Northampton pastor,
but he was dismissed in 1750, because, owing to
the growing laxity of church members, he insisted
upon "a higher and purer standard of admission to
the communion-table." Northampton is famed for
its educational development, the chief institution,
endowed by Sophia Smith in 1871, being Smith College
for women, having a thousand students and possessing
fine buildings, with an art gallery, music
hall and gymnasium. There are various attractive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
public buildings, including an Institution for Mutes
and the State Lunatic Asylum. The level land of
Nonotuck raises much tobacco, the Connecticut River
winding in wide circular sweeps among the fields
and meadows, but making little progress as it goes
around great curves of miles in circuit. Upon an
isthmus thus formed, with the broad river loop
stretching far to the westward, is "Old Hadley,"
the Connecticut having made a five-mile circuit to
accomplish barely one mile of distance. Across the
level isthmus from the river above to the river
below, stretching through the village, is the noted
"Hadley Street," the handsomest highway in natural
adornments in the Old Bay State. Over three
hundred feet wide, this street is lined by two double
rows of noble elms, with a broad expanse of greenest
lawn between, and nearly a thousand ancient trees
arching their graceful branches over it. This very
quiet street has perfect greensward, for it is almost
untravelled, and its inhabitants grow tobacco and
make brooms. Another of these wayward river
loops is the great "ox-bow" of the Connecticut,
where the river used to flow around a circuit of
nearly four miles and accomplished only one hundred
and fifty yards of actual distance, until an ice-freshet
broke through the narrow isthmus and made a
straight channel across it, which has become the
course of the river. The abandoned channel of the
"ox-bow" is now usually stored with logs awaiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
the sawmill. Hadley was the final home and burial-place
of Goffe and Whalley, the regicides, who fled
there from New Haven. When their house was
pulled down, it was said the bones of Whalley, who
died in 1679, were found entombed just outside the
cellar-wall. It was the house of the pastor, and
they were concealed in it fifteen years, from 1664 to
1679, their presence known only to three persons.
Once, during the hiding, Indians attacked the town,
and after a sharp fight the people gave way, when
there suddenly appeared "an ancient man with
hoary locks, of a most venerable and dignified aspect,"
who rallied them to a fresh onslaught, driving
the Indians off. He then disappeared, the inhabitants
attributing their deliverance to a "militant
angel." This was Goffe, and the tale is the chief
legend of "Old Hadley." General Joseph Hooker
of the Civil War was born in Hadley. At South
Hadley is the Mount Holyoke College for girls,
almost under the shadow of the mountain, amid
magnificent scenery, a noted institution with four
hundred students, where, during the past century,
have been educated many missionary women for
their labors in distant lands.</p>

<p class="center p2">MOUNT HOLYOKE AND BEYOND.</p>

<p>There is a grand view from the summit of Mount
Holyoke, spreading almost from Long Island Sound
to the White Mountains, and from the Berkshire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Hills in the west to the cloud-capped mountains Monadnock
and Wachusett, fifty miles to the eastward.
This is regarded as the finest view in New England,
for the wide and highly cultivated valley of the Connecticut,
with its wayward, winding stream flowing
apparently in all directions over the rich bottom-lands
cut up into diminutive farms and fields like so
many "plaided meadows," gives a charm that is
lacking in most other mountain views. The grand
panorama displays parts of four New England States.
Off to the northeast several miles is seen the town
of Amherst, with four thousand people, the seat of
another noted educational institution, Amherst College,
having over four hundred students and a fine
archæological museum.</p>

<p>The Hoosac Mountain range in the Berkshires
sends down various streams on its eastern slopes
through wild and romantic gorges into the Connecticut
Valley, and one of these is Deerfield River, coming
into the main stream some distance north of
Mount Holyoke. Here is the village of "Old Deerfield,"
settled in 1670, on the Indian domain of Pocomtuck,
and named from the abundance of deer
found in the forests. Its streets often ran with blood
in King Philip's and the later Indian Wars, and its
young men were then described by the quaint Puritan
chronicler as "the very flower of Essex County,
none of whom were ashamed to speak with the enemy
in the gate." Its guardian peaks are the Sugar Loaf,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
rising seven hundred and ten feet, and on the opposite
eastern side of the river Mount Toby, nearly
thirteen hundred feet high. King Philip, in his attack
upon the settlers here in 1675, made the tall
and isolated Sugar Loaf his lookout station, whence
he directed the movements of his forces, and a crag
on the top is yet called "King Philip's Chair."
Nearby, a monument marks the battlefield of Bloody
Brook in 1675, where the Indians killed Captain
Lathrop and eighty young men of Essex County.
The Fitchburg Railroad from Boston through Fitchburg
comes across the Connecticut Valley, and passing
the village of Greenfield, takes advantage of the
winding canyon of Deerfield River to ascend westward
to the wall of Hoosac Mountain, where the
great tunnel is pierced. The route is in a wild and
picturesque defile, in the heart of which is the pleasant
village of Shelburne Falls, where the stream
glides down a series of cataracts and rapids having
one hundred and fifty feet descent. Here are mills
making cutlery, hooks, gimlets and other things, and
there are sheep-pastures on the mountain sides, and
the people also tap the maple trees for sugar. There
are more villages among these mountains farther up
the gorge, where it may broaden to give a little arable
land, and at one of these, under the shadow of
the great Pocomtuck Mountain, was born in 1797
Mary Lyon, the devout and noted teacher who
founded Mount Holyoke College for girls. Finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the railway reaches the Hoosac wall, and leaving the
little Deerfield River which comes down from the
north, disappears westward in the tunnel.</p>

<p>The Connecticut River beyond the Massachusetts
northern boundary divides the States of New Hampshire
and Vermont, and its scenery, as ascended, becomes
more romantic and mountainous. At Northfield,
near the boundary, lived Dwight L. Moody, the
evangelist. Above the boundary, the Massachusetts
colony, as a protection to the river settlements, in
1724 built Fort Dummer, which was often attacked
by the French and Indians in their forays from
Canada, but never captured, and near it was made
the first settlement in Vermont, a village named in
1753 Brattleborough, in honor of Colonel Brattle of
Boston, one of the landowners. The Whetstone
Brook flows in, making a fine water-power, and the
town, now having six thousand people, is charmingly
situated on an elevated plateau, surrounded by lofty
hills. Brattleboro' is the centre of the Vermont
maple-sugar industry, and it has the largest organ-works
existing, those of the Estey Company. Just
south of the town rises Cemetery Hill, overlooking it
with a fine view, and here is the grand monument
erected in memory of the notorious James Fisk, Jr.,
who was a native of the place. It bears emblematic
female statues representing Railroads, Commerce,
Navigation and the Drama, and was executed by
Larkin G. Mead, the sculptor, also a native of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
town. It is recorded that when a lad, Mead worked
one long winter night on a snow figure at the head
of the Main Street, and next morning, the people were
surprised to see there a beautiful figure of the Recording
Angel, modeled in the purest snow. Southwest
of Brattleboro' is Sadawga Lake, in the town of
Whitingham, near which, in a poor log hut, Brigham
Young was born in 1801. He was a farmer's son,
educated in the Baptist Church, and afterwards emigrating
to Ohio, joined the Mormons there when
about thirty years old. When Rudyard Kipling had
his home in Vermont, it was about three miles north
of Brattleboro'.</p>

<p>From the eastern highlands of New Hampshire
the Ashuelot River flows into the Connecticut below
Brattleboro', and to the northeast in its alluvial valley
is Keene, the centre of an agricultural district,
and having about eight thousand people, some of
whom make leather goods, furniture and wooden
ware. The Ashuelot means a "collection of many
waters," and the place was named before the Revolution
in honor of Sir Benjamin Keene, a British
friend of Governor Wentworth of New Hampshire,
in consequence of which the colonial historian recorded
that "Keene is a proud little spot." To the
southeast boldly rises Mount Monadnock, its high and
rugged top elevated nearly thirty-two hundred feet,
and having a hotel half-way up its side. This mountain
is about eighty miles from Boston, and the town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
of Jaffrey, at its southeastern base, has an old
church, the frame of which was raised on the day of
the battle of Bunker Hill, the workmen claiming
that they heard the cannonading. The Williams
River, coming from the slopes of the Green Mountains,
flows into the Connecticut on the Vermont
side, at Bellows Falls, a picturesque summer resort
located at the river rapids, where there is a descent
of forty-two feet in about a half-mile, the power
being availed of for various factories. Above, at
Claremont, the Sugar River flows in from New
Hampshire, and to the eastward is the charming
Lake Sunapee, nine miles long, and surrounded by
wooded highlands, which has been often called the
American Loch Katrine. Over on the Vermont
side, north of Claremont, is Windsor, where it is recorded
that during a fearful thunder-storm, and with
the appalling news of the loss of Fort Ticonderoga
ringing in their ears, the deputies of Vermont adopted
the State Constitution, July 2, 1777. Southwest of
the village rises Ascutney Mountain, its Indian name
meaning the "Three Brothers," being supposed to
refer to three singular valleys running down the
western slope. Its summit is elevated thirty-three
hundred and twenty feet. William M. Evarts, who
was a native of Boston, has his summer home Runnymede
near Windsor, and at Cornish, nearby, Chief
Justice Salmon P. Chase was born in 1808, emigrating
to Ohio in 1830.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">HANOVER TO MEMPHRAMAGOG.</p>

<p>The White River, coming out from the Green
Mountains, flows into the Connecticut at a noted railway
junction, while a short distance above is the
Olcott Falls, a cataract amid picturesque surroundings
which provides power for large paper-mills at
Wilder, Vermont. To the northward is Hanover, in
New Hampshire, the seat of the most famous educational
foundation of northern New England, Dartmouth
College, having some seven hundred students.
Rev. Eleazer Wheelock began it in 1770, and his
name is preserved in the chief hotel. He started a
school in the forest to educate missionaries for the
Indians, having twenty-four students domiciled in
rude log huts. He also educated several Indians,
giving them Master's degrees; but after some of
them had returned to savage life he changed his
plan, and this object was subordinated to the purposes
of general and higher education, the College,
which was named for the Earl of Dartmouth, entering
upon a successful career subsequently to the
Revolution. Among the graduates have been Daniel
Webster, Amos Kendall, Levi Woodbury, Benjamin
Greenleaf, George P. Marsh, George Ticknor, Rufus
Choate, Thaddeus Stevens and Salmon P. Chase.
There are numerous buildings surrounding an extensive
elm-shaded campus, and also a spacious college
park. The Connecticut River above Hanover winds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
about the level fertile intervale, making numerous
"ox-bow" bends, and there appear numerous mountain
peaks which are outlying sentinels of the Franconia
Mountains to the eastward. The best known
of these is Moosilauke, rising forty-eight hundred
feet, which formerly was the "Moose Hillock" of the
colonists. On the western river bank is the Vermont
town of Newbury, founded by General Bailey of
Massachusetts. It is related that during the Revolution
a detachment of British troops came there to
capture him, but a friend who learned their object
went out where he was ploughing and dropped in
the furrow a note, saying, "The Philistines be upon
thee, Samson!" Bailey, returning down the long
furrow, saw the note, took the hint and escaped.
The crooked little Wells River flows out of the
Green Mountains and falls into the Connecticut at
the village of Wells River, nestling in a deep basin
among the high hills; and here is another important
railway junction, with routes going westward to Lake
Champlain, northward to Canada, and eastward to
the White Mountains. The latter route is up the
Ammonoosuc River valley, past Littleton, with its
glove factories and summer boarding-houses, on the
edge of the mountain district, and thence to Bethlehem
and into the heart of the White Mountain
region.</p>

<p>The Passumpsic River flows from Vermont into
the Connecticut a few miles above, and about ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
miles up that winding and hill-environed stream is
the picturesque town of St. Johnsbury, with about
seven thousand people, noted as the location of the
extensive Fairbanks Scale Works. St. John de
Crevec&oelig;ur, the French Consul at New York, was
very popular in the Revolutionary times and a benefactor
of Vermont, and this town, settled in 1786, was
named in his honor. It is related that in 1830, when
there was a good deal of excitement about hemp-culture
in the United States, the Fairbanks Brothers
established a hemp-dressing factory here, and one of
them conceived the idea of a platform-scale to weigh
the hemp, which construction was the origin of their
extensive business, the works sending scales all over
the world. The railroad route to Montreal and Quebec
ascends the Passumpsic, crosses the watershed,
passing Lake Memphramagog at Newport, and then
enters Canada. This noted lake is on the national
boundary, more than two-thirds of it being in Canada,
and is thirty miles long. Memphramagog means the
"beautiful water," and the mountain ranges enclosing
it with their wooded slopes present fine views. The
national boundary is marked by clearings in the forests
on either side of the lake. The massive rounded
summit of the Owl's Head rises thirty-three hundred
feet on the western shore in imposing magnificence,
and many other peaks are sentinelled all around.
Steamboats ply on the lake from Newport to Magog
at the foot, where its waters discharge northward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
into Magog River and thence flow over the vast
plain of Canada, which is so conspicuously contrasted
with the mountains to the southward, until at Sherbrooke
they reach St. Francis River, and finally the
St. Lawrence. Lake Memphramagog has its Indian
legends of massacre and escape, but its chief modern
tradition is of a noted smuggler named Skinner, who
in the early nineteenth century performed prodigious
feats of skill in eluding the revenue officers. Near
the boundary is Skinner's Island, having a spacious
cavern on its northwestern side. The smuggler
usually disappeared near this island, which came in
time to be named for him, and it is related that one
night the officers, having had a long chase, found his
boat on this island and turned it adrift on the lake.
The smuggler never appeared afterwards, but some
years later a fisherman, seeking shelter from a squall
under the lee of the island, discovered the cave hidden
under foliage and explored it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"And what do you think the fisherman found?</p>
<p>Neither a gold nor a silver prize,</p>
<p>But a skull with sockets where once were eyes;</p>

<p>And a vertebral column of giant size;</p>
<p>How they got there he could not devise,</p>
<p>For he'd only been used to commonplace graves,</p>
<p>And knew naught of 'organic remains' in caves;</p>
<p>On matters like those his wits were dull,</p>

<p>'Twas the smuggler's bones in the cave that lay:</p>

<p class="center p2">SOURCES OF THE CONNECTICUT.</p>

<p>The Connecticut River comes from the northeast
to its confluence with the Passumpsic, a stream of
reduced volume, flowing down rapids. There is only
sparse population above, and in New Hampshire,
some distance east of Colebrook, is the famous Dixville
Notch. This is an attractive ravine about ten
miles long, cut through the isolated Dixville Range.
It is not a mountain pass in the usual sense, but a
wonderful gorge among high hills, the cliffs being
worn and broken down into strange forms of ruin and
desolation. Theodore Winthrop describes the Dixville
Notch as "briefly, picturesque&mdash;a fine gorge
between a crumbling, conical crag and a scarped
precipice&mdash;a place easily defensible, except at the
season when raspberries would distract sentinels."
Approached from Colebrook to the westward, the
view is disappointing, as it is entered at a high level,
but after an abrupt turn to the right, the tall columnar
sides are seen frowning at each other across
the narrow chasm; cliffs of decaying mica slate
presenting a scene of shattered ruin that is mournful
to behold. To the right of the Notch, Table
Rock rises five hundred and sixty feet above the
road, being elevated nearly twenty-five hundred feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
above the sea, and is ascended by a rude stairway
of stone blocks called Jacob's Ladder. Its summit
is a narrow pinnacle only eight feet wide, with precipitous
sides. It gives an extensive view over the
Connecticut Valley northward to the Connecticut
Lakes, and over the upper Androscoggin Valley
to the southeastward. Its most impressive sight,
however, is much nearer, the narrow dreary chasm
immediately below, with its broken palisades that
seem almost ready to fall. Beyond is the Ice Cave,
a deep ravine where snow and ice remain throughout
the summer. Washington's Monument and the
Pinnacle, remarkable rock formations, rise high on
the north side of the Notch. Beyond the Notch
southeastward is the Androscoggin, which small
steamboats ascend to Lake Umbagog on the Maine
boundary. Still farther eastward and deep in the
Maine forests are the noted fishery waters of the
Rangeley Lakes, which have polysyllabic names, such
as Mooselucmaguntic, Mollychunkamunk, and Welokenebacook.
They are elevated fifteen hundred
feet above the sea and cover eighty square miles of
surface.</p>

<p>We have now ascended the picturesque Connecticut
River to its mountain sources. It has become
only a brook, and having followed it up to the Canadian
boundary of Vermont, it is found to come out
of Northern New Hampshire, flowing westward from
the Connecticut Lakes. The main lake of this group
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
is twenty-five miles northeast of Colebrook, covering
about twelve square miles, a favorite haunt of anglers,
and navigated by a small steamboat. The second
lake, four miles farther northeast through the forest,
has about five square miles of surface, and the third
lake is to the northward, covering two hundred acres.
The Canadian northern boundary of New Hampshire
is a low mountain range, and on its southern slope is
the fourth and highest lake, at twenty-five hundred
feet elevation above the sea, a pond of about three
acres, in which the great New England river has its
head. These Connecticut Lakes are in an almost
unbroken forest.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE WHITE MOUNTAINS.</p>

<p>To the eastward of the Connecticut River, which
we have explored from its mouth to the source, lies
one of the most attractive regions in America, the
White Mountain district. It covers about thirteen
hundred square miles, stretching forty-five miles
eastward from the Connecticut to the Maine boundary,
and being thirty miles wide from the Ammonoosuc
and Androscoggin on the north to the base
of the Sandwich range on the south. There are
some two hundred of these mountains rising from a
plateau elevated generally sixteen hundred feet above
the sea. They cluster mainly in two groups, separated
by a broad table-land ten to twenty miles wide,
the western group being the Franconia Mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
and the eastern group the Presidential range, or
White Mountains proper. Their great mass is of
granite, overlaid by mica slate; their scenery is
varied and beautiful; and the country has nowhere
a more popular resort than these mountains in the
summer. They send out from their glens and
notches various rivers, westward to the Connecticut,
eastward to the Androscoggin and Saco, and southward
to the Merrimack. The Indians called the
White Mountains Agiochook, meaning "the Mountains
of the Snowy Forehead and Home of the Great
Spirit," and held them in the utmost reverence and
awe. They rarely ascended the peaks, as it was believed
no intruder upon these sacred heights was
ever known to return. The legend was that the
Great Spirit once bore a blameless chief and his
squaw in a mighty whirlwind to the summit, while
the world below was overspread by a flood destroying
all the people. It was said that the great Passaconaway,
the wizard-king at Pennacook, was wont
to commune with celestial messengers on the summit
of Agiochook, whence he was finally borne to heaven.
The first white man who visited these mountains was
Darby Field, who came up from Portsmouth on the
seacoast in June, 1642, by the valley of the Saco.
The Indians tried to dissuade him, saying he would
never return alive, but he pressed on, attended by
two seashore Indians, passing through cloud-banks
and storms, reaching the highest peak, whence he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
saw, as he related, "the sea by Saco, the Gulf of
Canada, and the great lake Canada River came out
of;" and he found many crystals that he thought
were diamonds, from which the range long bore the
name of the "Chrystal Hills." Towards the close
of the eighteenth century colonists began moving
into the outlying glens; in 1792 Abel Crawford lived
on the Giant's Grave, now Fabyan's; in 1803 a small
inn was built there; and in 1820 a party of seven
ascended and slept on the summit of Mount Washington,
giving the principal peaks the names they
now have.</p>

<p>From the Connecticut River the chief route of
entrance to the White Mountain region is by railway
up the Ammonoosuc River alongside its swift-flowing
amber waters, and through the villages of North
Lisbon and Littleton, then coming to Bethlehem
Junction, whence a short narrow-gauge railroad leads
steeply up the hill-slope westward to Maplewood and
Bethlehem. This is one of the most populous resorts
of the district&mdash;Bethlehem Street&mdash;a well-kept highway,
stretching two miles along a plateau upon the
northern hill-slope at an elevation of almost three
hundred feet above the river. When old President
Dwight, in his early wanderings over New England,
first saw this place, it was known as the "Lord's
Hill," and he recorded it as remote and sterile,
having "only log huts, recent, few, poor and planted
on a soil singularly rough and rocky," but he saw "a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
magnificent prospect of the White Mountains and a
splendid collection of other mountains in this neighborhood."
It is now an aggregation of fine hotels
and summer boarding-houses, the whole "Street"
having a grand view of the imposing Presidential
range, seen nearly twenty miles to the eastward over
the Ammonoosuc Valley, while other mountain ranges
are to the north and west, so that Bethlehem is in a
vast amphitheatre, presenting, when the clouds permit,
an environment of unsurpassed magnificence.
To the southward, the visitors climb Mount Agassiz,
rising twenty-four hundred feet, formerly known as
the Peaked Hill, and get an unrivalled view of mountains
all around the horizon, the Green Mountains of
Vermont being plainly visible beyond the Connecticut
River to the westward. The southern flanks
of Mount Agassiz are drained by the pretty little
Gale River, flowing through a deep glen westward
to the Ammonoosuc at North Lisbon. Down in this
glen, to the southwest of Bethlehem, is the village of
Franconia, with numerous hotels and boarding-houses,
while to the southwest of the glen rises Sugar Hill,
another popular resort, with its great hotels set high
on the hilltop, and having superb views of the Franconia
and White Mountains to the eastward, and far
away westward over the Connecticut Valley where
the horizon is enclosed by the long line of the
Green Mountains. It is a breezy and health-giving
place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN.</p>

<p>To the southward of Bethlehem is the Franconia
group, of which Mount Lafayette is the crowning
peak, its pyramidal summit rising fifty-two hundred
and seventy feet. A notch is cut down into the
group, and through this, the Franconia or Profile
Notch, another narrow-gauge railway going up-hill
for ten miles in the forest, traverses the flanks of Lafayette
and leads to the Echo Lake and Profile
House, the most extensive hotel in the region. This
is in Coös County, the mountain county of northern
New Hampshire, getting its strangely pronounced
name from the Indian word <i>cooash</i>, meaning the
"pine woods," with which almost the whole country
was then covered. Here lived the Abenaqui tribe,
known as the "swift deer-hunting Coosucks." At
the highest part of the Notch, where its floor broadens
sufficiently for a few acres of smooth surface between
the enormous enclosing mountains, is built the hotel
and its attendant cottages, standing between two long,
narrow lakes at the summit of the pass, the waters
flowing out respectively north and south, from the
one, Echo Lake to Gale River and the Ammonoosuc,
and from the other, Profile Lake to the Pemigewasset,
seeking the Merrimack. The Pemigewasset means
"the place of the Crooked Pines," and Profile Lake
used to be called the "Old Man's Washbowl." On
its western side rises Mount Cannon, forty-one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
feet high, on the southeastern face of which is
the "Old Man of the Mountain," the noted Franconia
Profile. The mountain rises abruptly from the
edge of the lake, and twelve hundred feet above the
water is this "Great Stone Face," about which
Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote so famously. It is a remarkable
semblance of the human countenance, and
can be properly seen from only one position. Move
but a short distance either north or south from this
spot, and the profile becomes distorted and is soon
obliterated. It is composed of three distinct ledges
of granite projecting from the face of the mountain,
one forming the forehead, another the nose and upper
lip, and a third the chin. These three ledges are in
different vertical lines, the actual length of the profile
being forty feet, and they make an overhanging
brow, a powerful and clearly-defined nose, and a
sharp and massive projecting chin, the very mark of
complete decision of character, so that the realism
of the profile is almost startling. The Old Man's
severe and somewhat melancholy gaze is directed
towards the southeast over the lake, as if looking
earnestly down the Notch.</p>

<p>The white man's discovery of this profile was
made in the early nineteenth century by two road-makers,
mending the highway through the Notch.
Stooping to wash their hands in the lake, just at the
right spot, they casually looked up and saw it, being
struck instantly by the wonderful facial resemblance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
"That is Jefferson," said one of them, Thomas Jefferson
then being President of the United States, and
the stern countenance certainly looks like some of
his portraits. There he is, gazing far away, with
sturdy, unchanging expression, as he has done for
thousands of years. Thomas Starr King, who has
so well described these mountains, regards the "Great
Stone Face" as "a piece of sculpture older than the
Sphinx&mdash;an imitation of the human countenance
which is the crown of all beauty, that was pushed
out from the coarse strata of New England, thousands
of years before Adam." Yet a slight change
from the proper position for view greatly alters the
profile. Move a few paces northward, and the nose
and face are flattened, only the projecting forehead
finally being seen. Go a short distance to the southward,
and the Old Man's decisive countenance
quickly deteriorates into that of a toothless old
woman wearing a cap, and soon the lower portion of
the face is so distorted that the human profile is obliterated.
The Cannon Mountain bearing the famous
profile is a majestic ridge named from a spacious
granite ledge on its steep slope, presenting, when observed
from a certain position below, the appearance
of a cannon ready for firing. Its summit rises seven
hundred feet above the profile.</p>

<p>From the Profile Lake, the Pemigewasset River
flows southward, deep down in the narrow Franconia
Notch, the stream descending over five hundred feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
in five miles. Here is the "Flume," and beyond
it the gorge widens, giving a view which Thomas
Starr King has described as "a perpetual refreshment,"
for it extends far away southward over the
broadening intervale, one of the fairest scenes in nature,
stretching many miles to and beyond Plymouth.
The "Flume" is made by a brilliant little tributary
brook dashing along the bottom of a fissure for several
hundred feet, bordered by high walls rising
sixty to seventy feet above the torrent and only a
few feet apart. The water rushes towards the
Pemigewasset between these smooth granite walls,
and the awe-struck visitor walks through in startled
admiration. The "Pool" is beyond, a deep, dark
basin, into which the Pemigewasset falls, surrounded
by a high rocky enclosure, making an abyss over a
hundred feet across and one hundred and fifty feet deep.
There is also another pellucid green basin below, into
which the river tumbles by a pretty white cascade, this
being a huge pothole originally ground out by the
action of boulders whirled around in it by the current.
A galaxy of peaks environ this pleasant glen in the
Franconia and Pemigewasset ranges, the highest of
them, Mount Lincoln, rising fifty-one hundred feet,
and having Mount Liberty, a lower peak, to the
southward.</p>

<p class="center p2">TO PLYMOUTH AND BEYOND.</p>

<p>Emerging from the Franconia Notch, the broadened
valley reaches the attractive village of North
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Woodstock, another cluster of hotels and summer
boarding-houses in an attractive location. The
Pemigewasset receives its eastern branch, passes
other villages, is swollen by the brisk torrent of the
Mad River, and then, amid lower mountains and
broader vales, but still with the most delicious views,
comes to the typical White Mountain outpost town
of Plymouth, at the confluence of the Pemigewasset
and Baker Rivers, the latter coming in from the
northwest. Captain Baker with a company of Massachusetts
rangers, early in the eighteenth century,
attacked an Indian village here, and his name was
given the tributary stream. The Puritan colonists,
however, did not actually settle Plymouth until
1764. The town is full of summer cottages and
boarding-houses, is noted for its manufacture of fine
buckskin gloves, and has as its chief relic the little
old building, then the court-house, in which Daniel
Webster made his first speech to a jury. It was here
that Nathaniel Hawthorne suddenly died in May,
1864. He was travelling with his intimate friend,
ex-President of the United States Franklin Pierce,
and stopping overnight at a hotel, was found dead in
his room next morning, having passed quietly away
while sleeping. Far away beyond Plymouth the
bright Pemigewasset flows, receiving the outlets of
the Waukawan Lake, and of the beautiful and island-dotted
Squam Lake, its enclosing hills being most
superb sites for summer villas. This is the "mountain-girdled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Squam" of which Whittier sings, and a
giant pine tree is pointed out on its banks where the
poet used to sit and watch the lake by hours, and in
honor of which he wrote the <i>Wood Giant</i>, one of his
most admirable poems. The Pemigewasset joins the
outlet stream of Lake Winnepesaukee at Franklin,
and they together form the noble Merrimack, which,
in its useful flow to the sea, turns so many New England
mill-wheels. The Pemigewasset and its branches
drain the southern slopes of the Franconia ranges in
a vast primeval forest, whose inner solitudes are
rarely explored. Upon its eastern verge, far up on
the southwestern slope of Mount Willey, is Ethan's
Pond, said to be the most elevated source of the
Merrimack, twenty-five hundred feet above the sea.
Its most remote source is the Profile Lake, at the
head of the Pemigewasset, over which the "Great
Stone Face" mounts guard. Thus writes Thoreau
of the Merrimack:</p>

<p>"At first it comes on, murmuring to itself, by the
base of stately and retired mountains, through moist,
primitive woods, whose juices it receives, where the
bear still drinks it and the cabins of settlers are far
between, and there are few to cross its stream; enjoying
in solitude its cascades still unknown to fame;
by long ranges of mountains of Sandwich and of
Squam, slumbering like tumuli of Titans, with the
peaks of Moosilauke, the Haystacks and Kearsarge
reflected in its waters; where the maple and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
raspberry, those lovers of the hills, flourish amid
temperate dews; flowing long and full of meaning,
but untranslatable as its name, Pemigewasset, by
many a pastured Pelion and Ossa, where unnamed
muses haunt, tended by Oreades, Dryads and Nereids,
and receiving the tribute of many an untasted
Hippocrene:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"'Such water do the gods distil,</p>
<p>And pour down every hill,</p>
<p class="i1">For their New England men.</p>
<p>A draught of this will nectar bring,</p>
<p>And I'll not taste the spring</p>
<p class="i1">Of Helicon again.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Where it meets the sea is Plum Island, its sand
ridges scalloping along the horizon like the sea-serpent,
and its distant outline broken by many a tall
ship, leaning, still, against the sky. Standing at its
mouth, looking up its sparkling stream to its source,&mdash;a
silver cascade which falls all the way from the
White Mountains to the sea,&mdash;and behold a city on
each successive plateau, a busy colony of human
beavers around every fall. Not to mention Newburyport
and Haverhill, see Lawrence and Lowell,
and Nashua and Manchester and Concord, gleaming
one above the other."</p>

<p class="center p2">THE WHITE MOUNTAIN NOTCH.</p>

<p>The most remarkable pass in this attractive mountain
district is the great White Mountain Notch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
through the heart of the range. The valley of the
Ammonoosuc, farther ascended from Bethlehem Junction,
soon becomes an enormous chasm, cut deeply
down, and sweeping grandly around from the south
towards the east, disclosing in magnificent array the
splendid galaxy of Presidential Peaks as it is carved
along their western bases. This Notch is formed by
the headwaters of the Ammonoosuc rising among
the foothills of Mount Washington, flowing out towards
the west, and by the Saco River, flowing
southeast to the Atlantic. The Maine Central Railway
avails of this remarkable pass to get through
the White Mountains, and bring the traffic of northwestern
New England and Canada down to the sea.
To the northward arises the Owl's Head, around
which this railway circles after emerging from the
western portal of the Notch, and on the northern
flanks of this mountain are the head-streams of
Israel River, over beyond which is Mount Starr
King. Here is Jefferson, another gathering of
hotels and cottages, enjoying one of the finest views
of the White Mountain range, a popular resort, from
which there are grand drives around the northern
side of the Presidential range, seventeen miles eastward
to Gorham on the Androscoggin. It was on
this route that the famous view of these mountains
was painted by George L. Brown&mdash;the "Crown of
New England," owned by the Prince of Wales. Jefferson
Hill has been described by Starr King as "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
<i>ultima thule</i> of grandeur in an artist's pilgrimage
among the New Hampshire mountains." Seven
miles northwest, down the Israel River, is Lancaster,
with nearly four thousand people, another favorite
resort, though with more distant mountain views.</p>

<p>Where the Ammonoosuc, now become so small,
curves around from the east towards the south at the
western portal of the Notch, is Fabyan's, and here
are located some of the great hotels of the district,
right in front of Mount Washington. Between Fabyan's
and Crawford's, four miles southward, the
Presidential Range is the eastern border of the
Notch and is passed in grand review. The headspring
of the Ammonoosuc is on the slope of the
mountain alongside Crawford's, where the floor of the
valley is at its highest elevation, nineteen hundred
feet above the sea and three hundred and thirty feet
above Fabyan's. Higher than this the massive walls
of the Notch rise some two thousand feet farther,
and then slope backward up to the mountain summits,
which are much higher, but invisible from the
bottom of the valley. In front of Crawford's, where
there is a rather broader space, one looks southward
at the little oval lake which is the source of Saco
River. Just beyond is the "Gate of the Notch,"
where the rocky projections of the huge mountains
on either hand come out and almost close the passage,
leaving an opening of only a few feet width for the
diminutive Saco, here a mere rill, to start on its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
career, soon becoming a vigorous mountain torrent,
leaping and bounding down the canyon. Upon the
left hand of the stream the rocks have been cut out
to give the wagon-road room, and on the right hand
the railroad has hewn its route through the granite,
the three being closely compressed between the high
cliffs towering above. The Elephant's Head, formed
of dark rocks, with trunk and eye well fashioned,
looks down upon this "Gate," and just beyond,
another cliff presents the semblance of an Indian
papoose clinging to its mother's back. The little
Saco soon cuts the Notch deeply down, such is its
steep descent, so that in a short distance it becomes
a vast ravine. Thus, with the railway high up on a
gallery upon the mountain side, and the road deep
down by the Saco, the ravine is cleft between Mounts
Webster and Willard, the latter, as the chasm bends,
falling sharply off, a tremendous precipice of steep
and bare rock, when Mount Willey appears beyond.
Thus the Notch deepens and broadens, becoming an
enormous chasm, with the rapid river down in the
bottom, constantly increasing in volume. The Saco
is said to have been thus named by the Indians because
of the mass of water it brings down, the word
meaning "pouring out."</p>

<p>About three miles below the "Gate," the Notch
broadens into a sort of basin enclosed by the bare
walls of Mount Willard to the westward and Mount
Willey to the south, curving around the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
crescent-shaped slope of Mount Webster, which
makes the northern border. Here is the Willey
House, the scene of the Willey Slide, the great
tragedy of the Notch, a small and antiquated inn,
now adjoined by a modern hotel. In August, 1826,
there was a terrific landslide down the slope of Mount
Willey behind the old house, then kept by Samuel
Willey, from whom the mountain was afterwards
named. A heavy storm after a long drouth had
made a flood in the Saco, and Willey, fearing an
overflow, deserted his house in the night, with his
family of nine persons, to seek higher ground. Suddenly
the slide came down the mountain and the
flight was fatal, the avalanche of rocks and dirt
overwhelming them all, while a convenient boulder
behind the house so deviated it that, although almost
covered with rubbish, the building was uninjured. A
traveller who afterwards came through the Notch
found the half-buried inn deserted, with the doors
open, the supper-table spread, and a Bible lying open
upon it, with a pair of spectacles on the page, evidently
just as they had been left in the sudden
flight. Owing to the bend in the Notch there is an
unrivalled view down it from the summit of Mount
Willard, which thus stands practically at the head of
the deep pass. The southern face of this mountain
is a vast and almost perpendicular precipice, out on
the brow of which the observer stands to look down
the deep valley stretching far away, and enclosed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
between mountains rising nearly two thousand feet
above him on either hand, so that the view has a
singular individuality, as if one were looking at it
through a camera. The depth of the gorge and the
precipitous front of the mountain make the Notch a
tremendous gulf. The deeply concave chasm is
scooped out like an immense cylinder, having the
inside covered with dense green foliage, and grandly
bending around to the left until lost afar off behind
the distant projecting slope of Mount Webster. The
railroad stretches, a streak of brown, along the right-hand
wall of the valley, twisting in and out about the
promontories. Down in the bottom the thick forest
hides the wagon-road and the bed of the Saco until
they come out in a flat cleared green spot in front of
the Willey House. The towering mountain slopes
are scratched and scarred where slides have come
down, and two or three bright little ribbons of white
water are suspended on their sides, making cascades
that help fill the river beneath. Beyond the outlet
of the Notch, the eastern background is a vast sea of
mountain ranges and billowy peaks, having the bold,
white, pyramidal crown of proud Chocorua rising behind
them. This splendid scene, regarded by many
as the finest in the White Mountains, had a peculiar
charm for Anthony Trollope on his American visit.
He did not usually view America with favor, but he
emphatically wrote: "Much of this scenery, I say,
is superior to the famed and classic lands of Europe,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
adding "I know nothing, for instance, on the Rhine
equal to the view from Mount Willard and the mountain
Pass called the Notch." Most experienced observers
are convinced that as an impressive exhibition
of a deep mountain canyon with an enchanting background,
this is not surpassed in Switzerland.</p>

<p class="center p2">MOUNT WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>The Fabyan House, in front of Mount Washington,
stands upon the location of the "Giant's Grave,"
which was an elongated mound of sand and gravel
formed by the waves of an ancient lake, reacting
from the adjacent mountain slopes, and rising about
fifty feet. Being high, long and wide, it was just
the place for a house. The tradition is that once a
fierce-looking Indian stood upon this mound at night,
waving a flaming torch and shouting "No paleface
shall take root here; this the Great Spirit whispered
in my ear." The successive burnings of hotels on
this site would seem to indicate this as prophetic,
and in fact no hotel did stand there any length of
time until the projectors of the present large building,
after the last one was burnt, as if to avoid fate, had
the mound making the "Giant's Grave" levelled
and obliterated. Here was built the earliest inn of
the White Mountains in 1803 by a sawmill owner
on the Ammonoosuc River, named Crawford. His
grandson, Ethan Allen Crawford, the famous "White
Mountain Giant," was the noted guide who made the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
first path to ascend Mount Washington and built the
first house on its summit. Now, the mountain is
ascended from this western side by an inclined-plane
railway, reached by an ordinary railway extending
from Fabyan's five miles across to the base of the
mountain. The railway to the summit is about three
miles long, with an average gradient of thirteen
hundred feet to the mile, the maximum being thirteen
and one-half inches in the yard. It is worked
by a cog-wheel locomotive acting upon a central
cogged rail, and the ascent is accomplished in about
ninety minutes. It is an exhilarating ride up the
slope, for, as the car is elevated, the horizon of view
widens decidedly to the west and northwest, while
the trees of the forest get smaller and smaller, and
their character changes. The sugar-maples, yellow
birches and mossy-trunked beeches, with an occasional
aspen or mountain ash, are gradually left behind
in the valley, being replaced on the higher slope
by white pine and hemlock, white birch, and dark
spruces and firs hung with gray moss. These gradually
becoming smaller, soon the only trees left are a
sort of dwarf fir intertangled with moss. Then,
rising above the limit of trees, there is only a stunted
arctic vegetation, and this permits a grand and unobstructed
view all around the western horizon.</p>

<p>The route of the railway goes over and up various
steep trestles, the most startling of all being "Jacob's
Ladder," elevated about thirty feet and having the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
steepest gradient. Here is a perfect arctic desolation,
the surface being broken blocks and rough
stones of schist and granite, cracked, honeycombed
and moss-grown, having endured the storms and
frosts of centuries. There is a little vegetation
where it may get root, the reindeer-moss, saxifrage
clumps and sandwort of dreary Labrador or Greenland.
The view covers a wide expanse far away
westward to the Green Mountains, the landscape
being everywhere dark forests and peaks, with the
massive slopes of Mount Clay nearer to the northward,
and the whole Presidential range, Mounts Jefferson,
Adams and Madison, stretching beyond. As
one looks over the vast, dark, undulating wilderness
of peaks, it can be realized how the flood of emotion
made an entranced observer exclaim, in the hearing
of Mr. Starr King, "See the tumultuous bombast of
the landscape." Nearing the summit, the railway gradient
is less steep, and here an opportunity is given
to peer over the edge of the "Great Gulf," a profound
abyss on the eastern mountain slope between
Washington, Clay and Jefferson. This hollow gulf,
its sides and bottom covered with dark trees, relieved
by a little glistening pond at the bottom, stretches out
to the narrow valley along the eastern base of the
range, known as the Glen, down into which one can
look at an angle of about forty-five degrees. Rounding
the mountain summit, the train halts at a broad
platform in front of the Summit Hotel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>The top of Mount Washington is the highest elevation
in the United States east of the Rockies and
north of the Carolinas. It is what may be described
as an arctic island, elevated sixty-two hundred and
ninety feet, in the temperate zone, and displaying
both arctic vegetation and temperature, the flora and
climate being alike that of Greenland. An observatory
gives a higher view over the tops of the buildings,
and the first great impression of it is that the
view seems to be all around the world, limited only
by the horizon. In every direction are oceans of
billowy peaks, the whole enormous circuit of almost
a thousand miles, embracing New England, New
York, Canada and the sea. The grand scene is at
the same time gloomy. The almost universal forests
overspread everything with a mournful pall of sombre
green. The summit is spacious, and the contour of
the mountain can on all sides be plainly seen. Its
slope to the westward, like all of the Presidential
range, is steeper than to the eastward, down which a
wagon-road zigzags into the Glen. Upon the eastern
side, two long spurs seem to brace the mountain,
though profound ravines are there cut into it. The
southern slope of the summit pitches off suddenly,
while to the north there is a more gradual descent,
both the railway and wagon-road approaching that
way. The original Tip-Top House, the first inn
erected, is preserved as a curiosity, a low and damp
structure built of the rough stones gathered on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
mountain. The newer hotel is of wood, with a steep
roof, and is chained down to the rocks to prevent the
gales from blowing it over. There is a weather-signal
station at the summit, one of the most important
posts in the country.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE GRAND MOUNTAIN VIEW.</p>

<p>The Indians always held the White Mountains in
reverent awe. They were the religious shrine of
the Pennacooks, who roamed over the region between
the mountains and the sea. The early historian Josselyn
in the seventeenth century recorded, of these
Indians: "Ask them whither they go when they
dye; they will tell you, pointing with their finger, to
Heaven, beyond the White Mountains." Passaconaway,
the great wizard-chief of the Pennacooks,
who was finally converted to Christianity by the
Apostle Eliot, is said to have lived to the great age
of one hundred and twenty years, and then to have
been translated. The Pennacook tradition was that
in the cold of mid-winter he was carried away from
them in a weird sleigh drawn by wolves, that took
him to the summit of Mount Washington, whence he
was straightway received into Heaven:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The first house on the mountain, built by Ethan
Allen Crawford in 1821, was a small stone cabin
having the floor covered with moss for bedding, the
only furniture being a chest to contain blankets, and
a stove; a roll of sheet-lead serving as the "register,"
on which the guests scratched their names and the
date of visit. This cabin was swept away by a terrific
storm in August, 1826. Some time later an eccentric
individual took possession of the summit,
naming it "Trinity Height," and called himself the
modern "Israel of Jerusalem," proposing to inaugurate
in this exalted place a new Order, styled "The
Christian or Purple and Royal Democracy." With
an eye to business, he put toll-gates on the bridlepaths
and taxed each visitor a dollar. There were
bitter quarrels about the ownership for years afterwards,
and the first winter ascent was made by a
sheriff, who went up to serve a writ in 1858, and
found frost over a foot thick enveloping everything.
The lawsuits, however, were ultimately fought out
and settled, and the present owners have been undisturbed
for years.</p>

<p>The view from the summit is widespread. The
most distant objects that have been recognized are
Mount Beloeil, northwest in Canada, and Mount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Ebeeme, northeast beyond the Moosehead Lake in
Maine, each one hundred and thirty-five miles away.
These distant mountain tops are said to be brought
into view only by the aid of atmospheric refraction,
in raising them, as they are actually below the horizon.
Also northeast is Mount Abraham, sixty-eight
miles away; and were it not for this, Maine's greatest
mountain, Katahdin, in the wilderness of the upper
Penobscot, might be seen, but Abraham obstructs the
view. Katahdin, rising nearly fifty-four hundred
feet, is one hundred and sixty-five miles northeast.
Saddleback, at the head of the Rangeley Lakes, is
seen sixty miles away, and Bald Mountain, to the
right, one hundred miles off in Maine. To the eastward
is seen Mount Megunticook, in the Camden
range, on Penobscot Bay, one hundred and fifteen
miles off. To the east and southeast for many miles
is the ocean between Casco Bay and Cape Ann. The
sea, however, is never well viewed from Mount
Washington, because it is so nearly the color of the
sky at the horizon as to be difficult of acute discernment.
The moving vessels, however, can be readily
seen by the aid of a glass. The bright waters of
Sebago Lake are to the southeast, and beyond are the
shores of Casco Bay and the city of Portland, sixty-seven
miles off. The low round swell of Mount
Agamenticus shows faintly above the horizon, seventy-nine
miles south-southeast, and to the right
there is also a faint trace of the Isles of Shoals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
ninety-six miles off. To the southeast, twenty-two
miles, is the sharpest and noblest peak of all in the
galaxy of view, the high, white, pyramidal top of
Chocorua, having the broad island-studded Lake
Winnepesaukee to the right, with the distant double
peak of Mount Belknap seen over its clear waters.
Just to the west of south, and one hundred and four
miles distant, is the faint rounded summit of Mount
Monadnock, near the southwest corner of New Hampshire,
and nearer is Mount Kearsarge, seventy miles
off, and appearing much similar. The Nelson Pinnacle,
farther away, is to the right of Kearsarge.
The most distant mountain discernible in that direction
is Mount Wachusett, one hundred and twenty-six
miles off. To the southwest are seen Ascutney
and the twin Killington Peaks, near Rutland, Vermont,
eighty-eight miles away. To the west are
seen plainly the two Green Mountain peaks of Mansfield
and the Camel's Hump, seventy-eight miles off,
and over the northern slope of the latter can be
faintly detected the great Adirondack Mount Whiteface,
one hundred and thirty miles distant. Such is
the splendid circuit of mountains forming the horizon
for Mount Washington. Among the striking objects
in the view are the deep river valleys as they go out
from the Presidential range. The Peabody flows
through the Glen north to the Androscoggin, which
can be traced far northeast. The Ellis flows south
to the Saco, which goes out through the Notch and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
away southeast. The valley of the Ammonoosuc
runs off westward, where along the horizon is the
great trough of the Connecticut Valley stretching all
across the scene. Lakes and ponds are studded
among the dark summits, and at the observer's feet
are the springs feeding many great rivers of New
England, the Merrimack, to the southward, also having
its sources in this great wilderness of mountains,
which on all sides sends out babbling brooks and
silvery cataracts to bear their waters down to old
ocean.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE GLEN AND NORTH CONWAY.</p>

<p>The wagon-road from Mount Washington summit
down to the base, is on the eastern side, and is a little
more than eight miles long, with an average gradient
of one to eight, descending into the Glen and displaying
magnificent views. The descent occupies
about one hour, and the ascent five hours. On the
southeastern side of the mountain is Tuckerman's
Ravine, a huge gorge enclosed by rocky walls a
thousand feet high. This ravine usually displays
the "Snow Arch" until late in August, formed by a
stream flowing out from under the huge masses of
snow piled up in winter, until it gradually melts away
and collapses. The main Glen is formed by the deep
and thickly-wooded Pinkham Notch at the eastern
base of Mount Washington, its floor being at two
thousand feet elevation, and this Notch continues
north and south in deeply-carved stream beds, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Peabody River flowing northward to the Androscoggin
at Gorham and the Ellis River southward to the
Saco. The Peabody descends rapidly to the Androscoggin,
entering it at about eight hundred feet elevation,
the active town of Gorham being located
here in a beautiful situation, and having two thousand
people, at the northern gateway to the White
Mountains. The Androscoggin, having drained the
eastern mountain slopes, flows away into the State of
Maine to seek the Kennebec, and thence the sea. In
the Glen, in the coaching days, the old Glen House
was the headquarters at the foot of the road down
Mount Washington, but it was burnt in 1894, and
has not been rebuilt. To the eastward, bounding
the Glen, rise the Wild Cat Ridge and the impressive
Carter Dome, which would be a grand mountain
elsewhere, but here is dwarfed by the overshadowing
Presidential range on the western side. From
the Pinkham Notch the little Ellis River goes southward,
and below the outlet of Tuckerman's Ravine
is the beautiful Crystal Cascade, where it pours down
eighty feet over successive step-like terraces. Another
lovely cataract it makes is the Glen Ellis Fall,
which is considered the finest in the White Mountains,
on the slope of the Wild Cat Ridge. The
stream slides down an inclined plane of twenty feet
over ledges, and then falls seventy feet through a
deep groove, twisted by bulges in the rocks and
making almost a complete turn. Thus sliding, foaming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
and falling, the stream leaps nearly a hundred
feet into a dark green pool beneath. The Glen
broadens as it progresses southward, and soon becomes
a widened intervale, having many houses for
summer boarders.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig212" id="fig212"></a>
<img src="images/i235.jpg" width="550" height="377" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>Log Bridge over the Wild Cat, near
Jackson, N. H.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Here is the pleasant village of Jackson in a broad
basin, surrounded by low mountains, making splendid
views in all directions. There are the Tin, Iron,
Thorn and Moat Mountains, with others, the intervale
being almost covered with hotels, boarding-houses,
and the accessories of a popular summer resort,
and having pretty cottages perched on the
hill-slopes all about. This pleasant resting-place was
originally called New Madbury, but at the opening
of the nineteenth century it was named in honor of
President John Adams. It continued contentedly as
Adams until his son John Quincy became President,
and in 1828, when politics ran high and John Quincy
Adams was again a candidate, it happened that all
the votes in the town of Adams but one were given
to his competitor, Andrew Jackson, who was elected,
whereupon the town changed its name to Jackson.
Since then it has had a quiet history excepting once,
when, in 1875, they were building the railroad
through the White Mountain Notch, and the bears,
scared by the powder-blasts of the builders, came in
droves to Jackson and almost captured the town from
the frightened inhabitants. Just beyond Jackson, in
Lower Bartlett, the Ellis flows into the Saco in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
magnificent environment, the Ellis and the Eastern
Branch from the Carter range coming in together,
and making the Saco a great river. This is another
paradise for the seeker after the picturesque. From
the little church of the village, looking down over the
Saco intervales, when flooded with sunset light, gives
a most fascinating view. An enraptured visitor has
written of this landscape seen from the church door:
"One might believe that he was looking through an
air that had never enwrapped any sin, upon a floor
of some nook of the primitive Eden." Bartlett was
named in honor of Josiah Bartlett, a signer of the
Declaration of Independence, and its pioneer settler,
John Poindexter, came eighty miles on foot through
the wilderness from Portsmouth, dragging his few
household effects on a hand-sled, his wife riding an
old horse, with the feather-bed for a saddle, and carrying
the baby in her arms.</p>

<p>The Saco Valley broadens below, and Intervale,
another summer village, is passed, and then North
Conway, one of the most popular of the White
Mountain resorts. It spreads along a low sloping
terrace on the eastern verge of the widening valley,
and looks out upon the river with the elongated and
massive ridge of Moat Mountain grandly rising beyond.
The town is largely built along a pleasant
tree-bordered street, having the Presidential range
spread in magnificent array to the northwest, sixteen
miles away. To the southward the valley opens over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
long stretches of fertile lowlands until the Saco turns
sharply to the eastward, seeking the sea. To the
northward, the immediate guardian of the valley is
Mount Kearsarge, sometimes called Pequawket, rising
thirty-three hundred feet. Kearsarge means the
"pointed pine mountain," and its name was given
the famous warship which fought and sunk the privateer
"Alabama." It is the beauty of the surroundings
which gives North Conway its charm, and the
valley is called the "Arcadia of the White Hills,"
where the harshness of the granite ramparts beyond
are in strange contrast with the genial repose of
these meadows, and the delicate curves of the long,
swelling hills. The restfulness of the scene is its attraction,
everything contributing to its serenity; even
distant Mount Washington is said to "not seem so
much to stand up as to lie out at ease across the
north; the leonine grandeur is there, but it is the lion,
not erect, but couchant, a little sleepy, stretching out
his paws and enjoying the sun." Proud Chocorua,
which is not far away, is also said to even appear "a
little tired," as seen from North Conway, and as if
looking wistfully down into</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i12">"A land</p>
<p>In which it seemed always afternoon."</p>
</div></div>

<p>These Conway intervales of the Saco were the Indian
valley of Pequawket, and its people have long been
known as the Pigwackets. An Indian village first
occupied the site of North Conway, gradually giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
place to the rude huts of the colonists. It progressed
greatly by the trade through the mountain district,
before the advent of the railway, and was the chief
stage-coach headquarters in those days. Now it is
quiet and restful, the excitements of the coaching
times being gone. Three miles below, the magnificent
valley makes its grand bend to the eastward,
and the swelling Saco flows out through the State of
Maine and to the sea at the twin towns of Saco and
Biddeford.</p>

<p class="center p2">LAKE WINNEPESAUKEE.</p>

<p>The southern verge of the White Mountains has
many lower peaks and ridges, including the Ossipee
and Sandwich ranges, and finally they all run off into
the serrated shores of the extensive and beautiful Lake
Winnepesaukee, cut by long, sloping promontories and
abounding in islands. Thirteen miles southward from
North Conway, near Madison, is the largest erratic
boulder of granite known to exist, which was brought
down and dropped there by the great glacier and is
estimated to weigh eight thousand tons. It is seventy-five
feet long, forty wide, and from thirty to thirty-seven
feet high. Lake Winnepesaukee washes all
the southeastern flanks of the mountain region, and
has many peaks in grand array around its northern
borders. The Indians were so impressed with the
attractive scenery of the lake that they gave it the
poetical name, meaning "the Smile of the Great
Spirit." The Sandwich Mountains are spread across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
its northern horizon, showing the rocky summit of
Mount Tecumseh, rising over four thousand feet;
Tripyramid and its great "Slide," marked along its
face, where a vast mass of rocks and forest went
down the slope in the rainy season of 1869, moving
over a distance of two miles and falling twenty-one
hundred feet; the broad, rounded summit of the
Sandwich "Dome;" the sharp peak of Whiteface, also
scratched by a wide landslide on its southern slope;
the lofty top of Passaconaway, rising forty-two hundred
feet; and the proud apex of Chocorua, regarded
as the most picturesque of all these mountains. Its
much-admired peaks do not rise as high as some of
the others, thirty-five hundred feet, but are built of
a brilliant crystalline labradorite, called Chocorua
granite, presenting a striking appearance, and being
entirely denuded of trees. Chocorua was an Indian
prophet of the Pequawkets, whose family was slain
by the whites, and he took a terrible revenge. A
reward was offered for his scalp, and his pursuers
followed him to the mountain top and shot him down.
When dying, he invoked the curses of the Great
Spirit upon them, and the mountain now bears his
sonorous name. For years afterwards the curses
came true; pestilence raged in the adjacent valleys,
cattle could not be kept, for they all died, and the
people submitted humbly to the affliction, believing
it to be the realization of the Indian's imprecation.
But one day a scientific fellow wandered that way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
and being of an investigating turn, he soon found the
sickness was due to muriate of lime in the water.
After that discovery the Indian's curse went for
naught. Now the whole country roundabout is
healthy, and filled with the balsamic atmosphere
which invigorates the admiring thousands who come
to see the noble mountain. Thus sings Whittier of
it in <i>Among the Hills</i>, after a storm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Through Sandwich Notch the west wind sang</p>
<p class="i1">Good morrow to the cotter;</p>
<p>And once again Chocorua's horn</p>
<p class="i1">Of shadow pierced the water.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Above his broad Lake Ossipee,</p>
<p class="i1">Once more the sunshine wearing,</p>
<p>Stooped, tracing on that silver shield</p>
<p class="i1">His grim armorial bearing.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"For health comes sparkling in the streams</p>
<p class="i1">From cool Chocorua stealing:</p>
<p>There's iron in our northern winds;</p>
<p class="i1">Our pines are trees of healing."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lake Winnepesaukee, thus magnificently outstretched
in front of these lofty hills, is twenty-five
miles long and in the centre about seven miles wide,
covering a surface, exclusive of its many islands, of
seventy square miles. It has wonderfully transparent
water, being fed by springs, and its outline is very
irregular, pierced by deep, elongated bays, and
having broad peninsulas or necks of land stretching
far out from the mainland. The shores are composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
mostly of rocks, myriads of boulders being
piled up along the water's edge as if for a wall,
making an attractive rocky border with the foliage
growing out of it. An archipelago of islands of all
sizes and characters is dotted over the lake, there
being two hundred and seventy-four of them, several
having inhabitants. These are what Starr King
calls "the fleet of islands that ride at anchor on its
bosom&mdash;from little shallops to grand three-deckers."
This attractive lake is the storage-reservoir for the
many mills on the Merrimack, keeping their water-supply
equable throughout the year by a dam at the
Weirs, the western outlet, raising the surface six feet
and making its level about five hundred feet above
the sea. The railroads approach the lake both at
the Weirs and at Wolfboro' on the eastern verge,
and steamboats take the people over the lake to the
various settlements on its shores. Wolfboro' was
named after the British General Wolfe who fell on
the Plains of Abraham, and is the largest town on
the lake, having three thousand people. It has a
beautiful outlook over the water from the adjacent
high hills of Copple Crown and Tumble-Down Dick,
the latter getting its name from an unfortunate blind
horse "Dick," who once fell over a cliff on its
side.</p>

<p>The steamboat journey upon the lake discloses its
beauties, the gentle tree-clad shores with higher hills
and mountains behind them, the many pleasant cottages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
and the wonderfully clear green waters. It is
a curious place, all arms and bays and great protruding
necks of land, the open spaces dotted with islands,
so that everywhere there are long vista views across
the water and far up into the inlets of the shores,
while the large double peak of Mount Belknap
stands up massive and impressive at the southwestern
border, and opposite in the northeast is the
proud white summit of Chocorua. Edward Everett,
speaking of his extensive travels in Europe, says,
"My eye has yet to rest on a lovelier scene than that
which smiles around you as you sail from Weirs
Landing to Centre Harbor." The Weirs Landing is
at the head of a deep bay made by the outlet stream,
and is a popular summer camping-ground, the edge
of the water fringed with cottages and the adjacent
groves used by the camps. Many fish ascended the
outlet stream in the early times seeking the clear
waters, and the shallows at the outlet were availed of
by the Indians to set their nets, so that it naturally
got the name of the Weirs. Here, adjoining the
shore, is the ancient "Endicott Rock," which was
marked by the first surveyors sent up by Governor
Endicott of Massachusetts to find the source of the
Merrimack. The outlet stream goes through a region
of many ponds and lakes bordered by large icehouses,
the chief of these waters being Lake Winnisquam,
and all these extensive reservoirs help to
supply the great river of mill-wheels. The longest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
fiord indented in the southern shore of Winnepesaukee
is narrow and five miles long, called Alton
Bay, and it has a most attractive environment, with
Mount Belknap rising to the westward twenty-four
hundred feet high.</p>

<p>Upon the northern shore, grandly encircled by the
Sandwich Mountains, the most extensive bay running
up into the land is Centre Harbor, and here is
a popular place of summer sojourn. Its background
is a grand mountain amphitheatre from Red Hill to
the westward around to the dark Ossipee range to
the east, while in front, over the lake, is one of the
most charming views in nature, with its many islands,
long arms, deep bays, and strangely protruding elongated
necks of wooded land. Thus the delicious
water scene stretches for over twenty miles away,
having in the distance the twin peaks of Belknap and
the long and wavy summits of the attendant ridges
nestling low and blue at the southern horizon. Climbing
to the top of Red Hill, rising over two thousand
feet, this magnificent view is got in a way which one
charmed observer says "defies competition, as it
transcends description; it is the perfection of earthly
prospects." Whittier, who was passionately fond of
this whole region, after admiring it from Red Hill,
wrote the noble invocation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"O, watched by silence and the night,</p>
<p class="i1">And folded in the strong embrace</p>
<p>Of the great mountains, with the light</p>
<p class="i1">Of the sweet heavens upon thy face&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p class="i1">Of beauty still, and while above</p>
<p>Thy silent mountains speak of power,</p>
<p class="i1">Be thou the mirror of God's love."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Far over to the westward can be traced the outlet
stream, flowing past many lakes and seeking the
great river where these pellucid waters do such useful
work. Thus has Whittier, from this mountain
outlook, sung of the Merrimack:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"O child of that white-crested mountain whose springs</p>

<p class="center p2">NEWBURYPORT TO PORTSMOUTH.</p>

<p>We will start on a journey towards the rising sun,
searching for the elusive region known as "Down
East." Most people recognize this as the country
beyond New York, but when they inquire for it
among the Connecticut Yankees they are always
pointed onward. Likewise in Boston, the true
"Down East" is said to be farther along the coast.
Pass the granite headland of Cape Ann, and it is
still beyond. Samuel Adams Drake tells of asking
the momentous question of a Maine fisherman getting
up his sail on the Penobscot: "Whither bound?"
Promptly came the reply: "Sir, to you&mdash;Down
East." Thus the mythical land is ever elusive, and
finally gets away off among the "Blue Noses" of
the Canadian maritime provinces. We cross the
Merrimack from Newburyport in searching for it,
and enter the New Hampshire coast border town of
Seabrook, where the people are known as the "Algerines,"
and where salt-marshes, winding streams,
forests and rocks vary the view with long, sandy
beaches out on the ocean front, having hotels and
cottages scattered along them. Here are noted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
resorts&mdash;Salisbury Beach, Hampton Beach and Rye
Beach&mdash;all crowded with summer visitors. For over
two centuries on a certain day in August, the New
Hampshire people have visited Salisbury Beach by
thousands, to keep up an ancient custom. Here
Whittier pitched his <i>Tent on the Beach</i> he has so
graphically described. It was at Hampton village in
1737, that occurred the parley which resulted in
giving the infant colony of New Hampshire its narrow
border of seacoast. Massachusetts had settled
this region, and that powerful province was bound to
possess it, though the King had made an adverse
grant. Into Hampton rode in great state the Governor
of Massachusetts at the head of his Legislature,
and escorted by five troops of horse, formally demanding
possession of the maritime townships. He
met the Governor of New Hampshire in the George
Tavern, and the demand was refused. The latter
sent a plaintive appeal to the King, declaring that
"the vast, opulent and overgrown province of Massachusetts
was devouring the poor, little, loyal, distressed
province of New Hampshire." The royal
heart was touched and the King commanded Massachusetts
to surrender her claim to two tiers of townships,
twenty-eight in number, thus giving New
Hampshire her present scant eighteen miles of coast-line.
Rye Beach is the most popular of these seashore
resorts, and not far beyond is Piscataqua
River, the New Hampshire eastern boundary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>Here is the quaint and quiet old town of Portsmouth,
three miles from the sea, and having about
ten thousand people. Opposite, on Continental
Island, adjoining the Maine shore, is the Kittery
Navy Yard, where the warship "Kearsarge" was
built. Commerce has about surrendered to the
superior attractions of a summer resort at Portsmouth,
and the comfortable old dwellings in their extensive
gardens show the wealth accumulated by bygone
generations. To this place originally came the
"founder of New Hampshire," Captain Mason, who
had been the Governor of the Southsea Castle in
Portsmouth harbor, England, and at his suggestion,
the settlement, originally called Strawberry Bank,
from the abundance of wild strawberries, was named
Portsmouth. The Piscataqua is formed above by the
union of the Salmon Falls and Cocheco Rivers, both
admirable water-powers, serving large factories, and
the whole region adjacent to Portsmouth harbor is
bordered by islands and interlaced with waterways,
some of them yet displaying the remains of the colonial
defensive forts. At Kittery Point, near the
Navy Yard, was born and is buried the greatest
man of colonial fame in that region, Sir William
Pepperell, the famous leader of the Puritan expedition
that captured Louisbourg from the French in
1745. The noted "Mrs. Partington," B. P. Shillaber,
was born in Portsmouth in 1814.</p>

<p>Adjoining the harbor, and with a broad beach facing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
the sea, is Newcastle Island, incorporated for the
annual fee of three peppercorns, by King William
III. and Queen Mary in the seventeenth century.
Here lived in semi-regal state the Wentworths, who
were the colonial governors, their memory now preserved
by the vast modern Wentworth Hotel, whose
colossal proportions are visible far over land and sea.
The old Wentworth House at Little Harbor, wherein
was held the provincial court, still remains&mdash;an irregular,
quaint but picturesque building&mdash;its most
noted occupant having been the courtly and gouty
old Governor Benning Wentworth, who named Bennington
in Vermont, and whose wedding on his
sixtieth birthday has given Longfellow one of his
most striking themes, the "Poet's Tale" at <i>The Wayside
Inn</i>. The poet tells of the appearance one day
in Queen Street, Portsmouth, of Martha Hilton,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i11">"A little girl,</p>
<p>Barefooted, ragged, with neglected hair,</p>
<p>Eyes full of laughter, neck and shoulders bare,</p>
<p>A thin slip of a girl, like a new moon,</p>
<p>Sure to be rounded into beauty soon,</p>
<p>A creature men would worship and adore,</p>
<p>Though now, in mean habiliments, she bore</p>
<p>A pail of water, dripping, through the street,</p>
<p>And bathing, as she went, her naked feet."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The buxom landlady at the inn, "Mistress Stavers in
her furbelows," felt called upon to give her sharp
reproof:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"'O Martha Hilton! Fie! how dare you go</p>
<p>About the town half-dressed, and looking so!'</p>
<p>At which the gypsy laughed, and straight replied:</p>
<p>'No matter how I look; I yet shall ride</p>
<p>In my own chariot, ma'am.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The old Governor was a widower and childless, and
in course of time Martha came to be employed at
Wentworth House as maid-of-all-work, not wholly
unobserved by him, as the sequel proved. He arranged
a feast for his sixtieth birthday, and all the
great people of the colony were at his table.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"When they had drunk the King, with many a cheer,</p>
<p>The Governor whispered in a servant's ear,</p>
<p>Who disappeared, and presently there stood</p>
<p>Within the room, in perfect womanhood,</p>
<p>A maiden, modest and yet self possessed,</p>
<p>Youthful and beautiful, and simply dressed.</p>
<p>Can this be Martha Hilton? It must be!</p>
<p>Yes, Martha Hilton, and no other she!</p>
<p>Dowered with the beauty of her twenty years,</p>
<p>How lady-like, how queen-like she appears;</p>
<p>The pale, thin crescent of the days gone by</p>
<p>Is Dian now in all her majesty!</p>
<p>Yet scarce a guest perceived that she was there</p>
<p>Until the Governor, rising from his chair,</p>
<p>Played slightly with his ruffles, then looked down,</p>
<p>And said unto the Reverend Arthur Brown:</p>
<p>'This is my birthday; it shall likewise be</p>
<p>My wedding day; and you shall marry me!'</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"The listening guests were greatly mystified,</p>
<p>None more so than the rector, who replied:</p>
<p>'Marry you? Yes, that were a pleasant task,</p>
<p>Your Excellency; but to whom? I ask.'</p>
<p>The Governor answered: 'To this lady here;'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>
<p>And beckoned Martha Hilton to draw near.</p>
<p>She came, and stood, all blushes, at his side.</p>
<p>The rector paused. The impatient Governor cried:</p>
<p>'This is the lady; do you hesitate?</p>
<p>Then I command you as chief magistrate.'</p>
<p>The rector read the service loud and clear:</p>
<p>'Dearly beloved, we are gathered here,'</p>
<p>And so on to the end. At his command,</p>
<p>On the fourth finger of her fair left hand</p>
<p>The Governor placed the ring; and that was all:</p>
<p>Martha was Lady Wentworth of the Hall!"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="center p2">THE ISLES OF SHOALS.</p>

<p>Out in the Atlantic Ocean, six miles off the harbor
entrance, and ten miles from Portsmouth, is one
of the strangest places existing, the collection of
crags and reefs known as the Isles of Shoals, their
dim and shadowy outline lying like a cloud along the
edge of the horizon. There are nine islands in the
group, the chief being Appledore, rising from the
sea much like a hog's back, and hence the original
name of Hog Island. It covers about four hundred
acres, and the whole group does not have much over
six hundred acres. Star Island is smaller; Haley's
or Smutty Nose, with Malaga and Cedar, are connected
by a sort of breakwater; and there are four
little islets&mdash;Duck, White's, Seavey's and Londoner's&mdash;and
upon White Island is the lighthouse for
the group, with a revolving light of alternating red
and white flashes, elevated eighty-seven feet and
visible fifteen miles at sea. A covered way leads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
back over the crags from the tower to the keeper's
cottage. To this light there come answering signals
from the Whale's Back Light at the Piscataqua entrance,
from solitary Boon Island out at sea to the
northward, and from the twin beacons of Thatcher's
Island off Cape Ann to the south. As darkness falls,
one after another these beacons blaze out as so many
guiding stars across the waters. One of the noted
sayings of John Quincy Adams was that he never
saw these coast lights in the evening without recalling
the welcoming light which Columbus said he saw
flashing from the shore, when he discovered the New
World.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"I lit the lamps in the lighthouse tower,</p>
<p class="i1">For the sun dropped down and the day was dead;</p>
<p>They shone like a brilliant clustered flower,</p>
<p class="i1">Two golden and five red."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Isles of Shoals are a remarkable formation&mdash;rugged
ledges of rock out in the ocean bearing
scarcely any vegetation; and on some of them not a
blade of grass is seen. Four islands stretching in a
line make the outside of the strange group&mdash;bare
reefs, with water-worn, flinty surfaces, against which
the sea beats. Not a tree grew anywhere until a
little one was planted on Appledore, in front of the
hotel, and another dwarf was coaxed to grow in the
little old graveyard on Star Island. Their best vegetation
was low huckleberry bushes, until someone
thought of gathering soil enough to make grass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
patches for a cow or two. The utter desolation of
these rocks, thus cast off apparently from the rest
of the world, can hardly be realized, yet they have
their admirers. Celia Thaxter, the poetess, was the
daughter of the White's Island lightkeeper, and to
her glowing pen much of their fame is due. She
died on Appledore in 1894. The curious name of
these islands first appears in the log of their discoverer,
Champlain, who coasted along here in 1605.
They were always prolific fishery grounds, and the
name seems to have been given them from "the
shoaling or schooling of the fish around them." In
a deed from the Indians in 1629 they are called the
Isles of Shoals. Captain John Smith visited and
described them in 1614, and with his customary
audacity tried to name them "Smith's Islands," but
without success. The boundary-line dividing Maine
and New Hampshire passes through the group between
Star and Appledore. The peculiar grouping
makes a good harbor between these two, opening
westward towards the mainland, and amply protected
from the sea by the smaller islands outside. These
rugged crags resemble the bald and rounded peaks
of a sunken volcano thrust upward from the sea, with
this little harbor forming its crater. When Nathaniel
Hawthorne visited them, he wrote: "As much as
anything else, it seems as if some of the massive
materials of the world remained superfluous after the
Creator had finished, and were carelessly thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
down here, where the millionth part of them emerge
from the sea, and in the course of thousands of
years have become partially bestrewn with a little
soil." Their savagery during violent storms, when
surrounded by surf and exposed to the ocean's wildest
fury, becomes almost overwhelming, and they
actually seem to reel beneath the feet.</p>

<p>Star Island originally had a village of fishermen,
until they were sent away to make room for the
summer hotel. It was the town of Gosport, and its
little church and tiny bell-tower are visible from afar
over the water. The original church was built of
timbers from the wreck of a Spanish vessel in 1685,
and the present little stone church is as old as the
nineteenth century. It had several faithful pastors,
who were buried on the island, among them Rev.
John Brook, of whom the quaint historian Cotton
Mather tells the anecdote illustrating the efficacy of
prayer: A child lay sick and so nearly dead those
present believed it had actually expired, "but Mr.
Brook, perceiving some life in it, goes to prayer, and
in his prayer used this expression: 'Lord, wilt thou
not grant some sign before we leave prayer that thou
wilt spare and heal this child? We cannot leave
thee till we have it.' The child sneezed immediately."
On the highest part of Star Island is the
broken monument to John Smith, put up by some of
his admirers not long ago, bearing the three Moslem
heads representing the Turks he had slain, but vandals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
have ruined it. The diminutive fort defending
Star Island in colonial times has been abandoned
more than a century, and nestling beneath it is the
old graveyard, part of the walls remaining, and a
few dilapidated gravestones. All the original inhabitants
of the island are dead, their descendants scattered,
and fashionable pleasuring now dominates this
reef and its restless waters.</p>

<p>As might be expected, a place like these islands
was a favorite haunt for pirates in the colonial days.
Around them cruised Captain Kidd, the notorious
Blackbeard, and Hawkins, Phillips, Low, Ponad, and
other famous pirates, and in fact the ghost of one of
Kidd's men is said to still haunt Appledore. Many
and bold were the gentry who in those days hoisted
the "Jolly Roger" flag, with its grinning skull and
cross-bones, and cruised in this picturesque region
for glory and plunder. It was near the route between
Boston and the Provinces and to Europe, and
hence the valuable prey that allured them. Here
sailed Captain Teach of ferocious countenance, piercing
black eyes and enormous beard, who came to be
familiarly known and feared as "Blackbeard." He
was said to be "in league with the Devil and the
Governor of North Carolina," and had an uncomfortable
habit of firing loaded pistols in the dark, without
caring much who got hit. In fact, it is recorded
he once told his trusty crew he had to kill a man occasionally
merely to prove he was captain. He also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
kept a diary, making characteristic entries, such as
these: "Rum all out; our company somewhat sober;
rogues a-plotting; confusion among us; so I looked
for a prize." And this next day: "Took a prize
with a great deal of liquor on board; so kept the
ship's company hot, and all went well again." Blackbeard
is supposed to have buried treasures on these
islands, and the fishermen tell how they have seen
the ghost of his mistress, gazing intently seaward, on
a low, projecting point of White Island, a tall and
shapely figure wrapped in a long cloak. Blackbeard
ruled these waters until Lieutenant Maynard, with
two armed sloops, went after him, captured his ship,
met him in single combat, and after a hand-to-hand
fight, in which both received fearful wounds, finally
pinned the pirate to the deck with his dagger, closing
his interesting career.</p>

<p>Captain Kidd, who sailed in these parts, was not
so ferocious as Blackbeard. It is said that at first
he always swore-in his crew on the Bible, but afterwards
finding this interfered with business, he buried
his Bible in the sand. Captain Low captured a
fishing-smack off these islands, but disappointed of
booty, had the crew flogged, and then gave each
man the alternative of being hanged or of three
times vigorously cursing old Cotton Mather, which
latter, it is recorded, "all did with alacrity." It is
probable this punishment was inflicted by the pirate
because it was the custom of the Puritan clergymen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
when pirates were condemned, to have them brought
into church, and as a proper preliminary to the
hanging, preach long and powerful sermons to them
on the enormity of their crimes and the torments
awaiting in the next world. This same Captain Low
is said to have once captured a Virginia vessel, and
was so pleased with her captain that he invited him
to share a bowl of punch. The Virginian, however,
demurred, having scruples about drinking with a
pirate, whereupon Low presented a cocked pistol to
his ear and a glass of punch to his mouth, pleasantly
remarking: "Either take one or the other." The
captain took punch. Another rover of the seas,
Phillips, captured the Dolphin, a fishing-vessel, and
made all her crew turn pirates. John Fillmore, one
of them, started a mutiny, killed Phillips, and took
the Dolphin back to Boston. His great-great-grandson
was President Millard Fillmore. There was also
at one time a famous woman pirate in this region&mdash;Anne
Bonney, an Irish girl from Cork, who fell in
love with Captain Rockham, a pirate, who was afterwards
captured and hanged. Before the capture she
fought bravely, and, as she expressed it, "was one
of the last men left upon the deck." There was
much that was fascinating in the desperate careers
of the lawless buccaneers who swept the New England
coasts in the seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries. They were for years masters of the ocean,
and they even sent defiance to the King himself:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Go tell the King of England, go tell him thus from me,</p>
<p>Though he reigns king o'er all the land, I will reign king at sea."</p>
</div></div>

<p>All around the Isles of Shoals, when the sun sinks
and twilight comes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"From the dim headlands many a lighthouse gleams,</p>
<p>The street lamps of the ocean."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Far away to the northeast a single white star appears
eleven miles off, on the solitary rock of Boon
Island, out in mid-ocean, where not a pound of soil
exists, excepting what has been carried there. One
of the worst wrecks of modern times occurred on this
rock before the lighthouse was built. The "Nottingham,"
from London, was driven ashore, the crew with
difficulty gaining the island when the ship broke up.
They had no food; day by day their sufferings from
cold and hunger increased; the mainland was in full
view and they built a raft of pieces of wreck to try
and get there, but it was swamped; they signalled
passing vessels, but could not attract attention.
Gradually they sank into hopelessness, but thought
to make a final effort by constructing another rude
raft, on which two of them tried to reach the shore.
It too was wrecked, being afterwards found on the
beach with a dead man alongside. Then hope entirely
failed them, and to sustain life they became
cannibals, living on the body of the ship's carpenter,
sparingly doled out to them by the captain. Eventually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
the survivors were rescued, the wrecked raft
being their preserver. When it was found, the
people on shore started a search for the builders, and
they were discovered and taken off the island, after
twenty-four days of starvation. Then the lighthouse
was built on Boon Island, and its steady white star
gleams in nightly warning:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="center p2">MOUNT AGAMENTICUS TO OLD ORCHARD.</p>

<p>Beyond the Piscataqua River is the famous "Pine-Tree
State," noted for its noble forests and its many
splendid havens. This is Whittier's "hundred-harbored
Maine," and such are the sinuosities of its
remarkable coast, that while its whole distance from
Kittery Point to Quoddy Head is two hundred and
seventy-eight miles, the actual length of the shore-line
stretches to twenty-five hundred miles, and if
straightened out would reach across the Atlantic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
The great landmark of this coast beyond Kittery,
standing in gloomy isolation down by the shore, is
the "sailor's mountain," Agamenticus, rising six
hundred and seventy-three feet, a sentinel visible far
out at sea. It is a solitary eminence, lifted high
above the surrounding country and having three
summits of almost equal altitude, the sides clothed
with dark forests. This graceful and imposing
mountain gave James Russell Lowell an attractive
theme in his <i>Pictures from Appledore</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"He glowers there to the north of us,</p>
<p>Wrapt in his mantle of blue haze,</p>
<p>Unconvertibly savage, and scorns to take</p>
<p>The white man's baptism on his ways.</p>
<p>Him first on shore the coaster divines</p>
<p>Through the early gray, and sees him shake</p>
<p>The morning mist from his scalplock of pines;</p>
<p>Him first the skipper makes out in the west</p>
<p>Ere the earliest sunstreak shoots tremulous,</p>
<p>Plashing with orange the palpitant lines</p>
<p>Of mutable billow, crest after crest,</p>
<p>And murmurs 'Agamenticus!'</p>
<p>As if it were the name of a saint."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Almost under the shadow of the mountain is the
quiet old town of York, the "ancient city of Agamenticus,"
founded by Sir Ferdinando Gorgues in
the early seventeenth century as Gorgeana, the place
of first settlement in Maine. Now it is a summer-resort,
with York Beach stretching along the coast,
having Cape Neddick at its northern end thrust out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
into the sea, with the curious rocky islet of the Nubble,
and surmounting lighthouse, off its extremity.
Four miles beyond, there projects the frowning promontory
of the Bald Head Cliff and its lofty Pulpit
Rock, an almost perpendicular wall rising ninety
feet, with the breakers beating at its base. Farther
along, the coast is a succession of magnificent
beaches all the way to Casco Bay, and the broad
road they furnish is the chief highway. Wells is a
popular summer resort, and beyond it the charming
little Kennebunk River comes down through the hills
and woods and over falls, past Kennebunkport to the
sea. Then the broader Saco River is reached, its
ample current drawn from the White Mountains,
plunging down a cataract of fifty-five feet around
which are gathered the mills of the twin towns of
Biddeford and Saco, having the river between them,
and a population of over twenty thousand. Their
steeples rise above the trees, and one of these, a
French Catholic church in Biddeford, has little trees
growing out of its spire. Sawmills and cotton-mills
largely use the ample power of the Saco Falls. The
beach fronting Saco gradually dissolves into the noted
Old Orchard Beach, stretching nearly ten miles to
Scarborough River, the finest beach in New England,
over three hundred feet wide and named from an
apple orchard that once stood there, of which the last
ancient tree died before the Revolution. There are
numerous hotels and boarding-houses scattered along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
this broad beach, and its people completed in 1898
one of the longest ocean piers existing, which extends
nearly two thousand feet into the sea. Scarborough
Beach is beyond, and around the broad end
of Cape Elizabeth is the entrance to Casco Bay,
marked by the "Two Lights" on the eastern extremity
of the cape, these powerful white beacons
being about nine hundred feet apart. Almost under
their shadow, in 1862, the Allan Line steamer "Bohemian"
was wrecked with fearful loss of life.
Within Casco Bay is an archipelago of over three
hundred and fifty islands, stretching eastward for
twenty miles to the mouth of the Kennebec. Many
of these islands are favorite summer resorts, and
their surrounding waters are always haunts for
yachts, the bay being an admirable yachting ground.</p>

<p class="center p2">PORTLAND.</p>

<p>The city of Portland, with over forty thousand
people, is the metropolis of Maine and the winter
port of Canada, which has to use it when the river
St. Lawrence is frozen. It is built upon an elevated
and hilly peninsula projecting eastwardly into Casco
Bay, and having commanding eminences at each extremity,&mdash;the
western being Bramhall's Hill and the
eastern Munjoy's Hill,&mdash;spacious promenades having
been made around both for outlooks. The city being
almost surrounded by water, and the bold shores of
the bay enclosing so many beautiful tree-clad islands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
there are magnificent views in every direction. The
streets are finely shaded, mostly with elms, so that it
is often called the "Forest City." This was the Indian
land of Machigonne, to which the English first
came in 1632, and there yet remain some stately
trees of that time, which are among the charms of
the pleasant park of the Deering Oaks at the West
End, from which State Street leads into the best residential
section, bordered by double rows of elms,
making a grand overarching bower. Here, in a
circle at the intersection of Congress Street, is an
impressive bronze statue of Longfellow, who was
born in Portland in 1807, the poet sitting meditatively
in his chair. Among the other distinguished
citizens have been Commodore Edward Preble, Neal
Dow, N. P. Willis, Mrs. Parton (Fanny Fern) and
Thomas B. Reed, who long represented Portland in
Congress. The city has an air of comfort, and its
broad-fronted, vine-covered homes look enticing.
From its hills the outlook is superb, particularly that
from the Eastern Promenade encircling Munjoy's
Hill, where the view is over Casco Bay and its many
arms and forest-fringed rocky islands. On the eastern
side, Falmouth Foreside stretches out to the distant
ocean, while the western shore is the broad
peninsula terminating in Cape Elizabeth. This hill
has a commanding prospect over one of the most bewitching
scenes in nature,&mdash;the island-studded Casco
Bay, having the famous Cushing's Island at the outer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
verge of the archipelago protecting most of the harbor
from the ocean waves. Upon other islands down
the bay are three old forts, two of them abandoned,
while the flag floats over the more modern works of
Fort Preble. Portland was originally called Falmouth,
not receiving the present name till 1786. In
a beautiful spot on Munjoy's Hill is the monument to
the founder, its inscription being "George Cheeves,
Founder of Portland, 1699." Upon this hill is the
old cemetery containing Preble's grave. He commanded
the American squadron in the war against
Tripoli in 1803, and died in Portland in 1807. Also
in this cemetery rest alongside each other two noted
naval officers of the War of 1812-14 with England&mdash;Burrows
and Blythe. They commanded rival warships,
the American "Enterprise" and the British
"Boxer," that fought on Sunday, September 5, 1814,
off Pemaquid Point, near the mouth of the Kennebec,
the adjacent shores being covered with spectators.
The "Enterprise" captured the "Boxer"
and brought her a prize into Portland harbor. Both
commanders were killed in the fight, and their bodies
were brought ashore, each wrapped in the flag he had
so bravely served, and the same honors were paid
both in the double funeral. Longfellow recalls this
as one of the memories of his youth:</p>

<p class="center p2">THE ANDROSCOGGIN.</p>

<p>Maine has more than fifteen hundred lakes, scattered
everywhere through its extensive forests.
Seventeen miles northwest of Portland is Sebago
Lake, one of the most attractive, an islet-dotted expanse,
fourteen miles long and ten miles wide, its Indian
name meaning "the stretch of water." Into it
flows the rapid and devious Songo River, discharging
Long Lake, a little over two miles distant, but the
boat journey on the river to that lake is for six
miles and around twenty-seven bends. Thirty-eight
miles northwest of Portland is Poland Springs, the
chief inland watering-place of Maine, with pure air,
the finest waters and large hotels. To the northward
the Androscoggin River, flowing from the flanks of
the White Mountains, sweeps eastwardly across the
State, and then turns southward to unite its current
with the Kennebec in Merry Meeting Bay. Not far
from the New Hampshire boundary it pours down the
Rumford Falls, one of the finest of cataracts, the
river making three or four leaps over ragged, granite
ledges, aggregating one hundred and sixty feet descent,
the final fall being nearly seventy feet, making
a great roaring, heard for a long distance. Here is a
town of textile and paper-mills, with three thousand
people. Having turned to the southward, the river
comes to the Livermore Falls, another manufacturing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
village on the Indian domain of Rockomeka, or the
"great corn land." Here were born the famous
brothers Israel, Elihu B. and Cadwalader C. Washburne,
who were so long in the public service, representing
Maine, Illinois and Wisconsin. A handsome
Gothic public library built of granite has been
erected as their memorial. Farther along is Leeds,
the birthplace of General Oliver O. Howard, and
then some distance below the river plunges down the
Lewiston Falls of fifty-two feet at the second city in
Maine, the towns of Auburn and Lewiston having
twenty-five thousand population, chiefly employed in
the manufacture of textiles, there being large numbers
of French Canadians in the mills. Bates College,
with two hundred students, is one of the chief
buildings of Lewiston.</p>

<p>Eastward from Casco Bay to the Androscoggin is
a rough wooded country becoming, however, rather
more level as the river is approached. The Androscoggin
having come down from the north, sweeps
around to the northeast to enter Merry Meeting
Bay, and at the bend, about thirty miles from Portland,
is Brunswick, at the head of tidewater, with
over six thousand population, largely employed in its
mills. The river falls forty-one feet here in three
separate cataracts, giving an enormous water-power.
This was the Indian Pejepscot, where the English
built Fort George in 1715, known as "the key of
Western Maine." The city is chiefly noted now as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
the seat of Bowdoin College, the chief educational
institution of Maine, incorporated in 1794, and opened
in 1802 with an endowment by the State. It has
nearly four hundred students and attractive buildings,
the most conspicuous one being surmounted by
twin spires, which are seen from afar in approaching
the town, rising above the trees with a thick growth
of pines behind them. This college had President
Franklin Pierce, Hawthorne, Longfellow and Chief
Justice Fuller among its graduates, and Longfellow
was its professor of modern languages until 1835,
when he was called to Harvard. Harriet Beecher
Stowe wrote <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> in Brunswick in
1851-2, when her husband was in the Bowdoin College
faculty. Pierre Baudouin, a Huguenot refugee
from La Rochelle, came to Portland in 1687; and his
grandson, who was Governor of Massachusetts in
1785-6, had his name given the college, the great-grandson,
James Bowdoin 2nd, the noted diplomatist,
having been most liberal in his gifts to it. Beyond
Brunswick the Androscoggin broadens into Merry
Meeting Bay, which is finally absorbed by the Kennebec.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE KENNEBEC.</p>

<p>The Kennebec River, the Indian "large water
place," is one of the greatest streams of Maine, having
its source in its largest lake, Moosehead, surrounded
by forests. This lake is at an elevation of
over a thousand feet, is thirty-five miles long, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
has a surface of two hundred and twenty square
miles. The shores are generally monotonous, excepting
where the long peninsula of Mount Kineo is
projected from the eastern side so far into the lake as
to narrow it to little more than a mile width. Mount
Kineo is nine hundred feet high, rising abruptly on
the south and east, but sloping gradually to the water
on the other sides. To the northeast, Spencer Mountain
is seen rising four thousand feet, with Katahdin,
the Indian "greatest mountain," in the distance.
This magnificent summit, the highest in Maine, rises
nearly fifty-four hundred feet. All about Moosehead
Lake and far to the northward over the Canadian
border is a vast forest wilderness, full of lakes and
streams, visited chiefly by the timber-cutters and
sportsmen, and one of the favorite hunting and
angling regions of the country. From the southwestern
extremity of the lake the Kennebec River
flows out towards the sea, and in a winding course
of a hundred miles descends a thousand feet of
rapids and cataracts, until it reaches the tidal level
at Augusta. It narrows at Solon to only forty feet
as it goes over the Carrituck Falls of twenty feet.
Then it passes Old Point and comes to Norridgewock,
where several ancient elms of enormous size
border the street along the river bank. This is
the scene of Whittier's poem of <i>Mogg Megone</i>, and
along here lived the ancient Norridgewocks. At Old
Point was their chief town, and as early as 1610
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
French missionary priests sent out from Quebec settled
among them, the famous Jesuit, Sebastian Rale,
coming about 1670 and living there over forty years,
being not only the spiritual but finally the political
head of the tribe. He was a man of high culture,
and had been professor of Greek at the College of
Nismes, in France. The tribe belonged to the
Canabis branch of the Abenaquis nation, and he prepared
a complete dictionary of their language (now
preserved in Harvard University), which he described
as "a powerful and flexible language&mdash;the
Greek of America."</p>

<p>In the early eighteenth century wars broke out between
these Indians under the French flag and the
Puritans of New England. It is said that Father
Rale had a superb consecrated banner floating before
his church, emblazoned with the cross, and a bow
and sheaf of arrows. This was often borne as a
crusading flag against the Puritan border villages.
Norridgewock was destroyed by a sudden raid in
1705, and peace following, an envoy was sent to
Boston to demand an indemnity, and also that workmen
be sent to rebuild the church. Both were promised
on condition that they would accept a Puritan
pastor, but this was declined. The Indians rebuilt
their village, and it was again destroyed by a plundering
raid in 1722, and in revenge they then made
a fearful ravaging expedition in which the Maine
coast towns paid dearly. The English seacoast colonists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
consequently decided that for protection Norridgewock
must be taken and the tribe driven away,
a price being set upon Rale's head. In August,
1724, a strong party of New England rangers
marched secretly and swiftly, and, before their presence
was known, had surrounded the village and
began firing through the wigwams. A few Indians
escaped, but nearly the whole tribe&mdash;men, women
and children&mdash;were massacred. Charlevoix writes
of it that "the noise and tumult gave Père Rale notice
of the danger his converts were in, and he fearlessly
showed himself to the enemy, hoping to draw
all their attention to himself, and to secure the safety
of his flock at the peril of his life. He was not disappointed.
As soon as he appeared the English set
up a great shout, which was followed by a shower of
shot, when he fell dead near to the cross which he
had erected in the midst of the village. Seven chiefs,
who sheltered his body with their own, fell around
him." His mutilated body was afterwards found at
the foot of the cross and buried there. The place
lay desolate for a half-century, when English settlers
came in 1773, and in 1833 a granite memorial obelisk
was erected on the site of the ancient church. Thus
Whittier describes the tragedy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Fearfully over the Jesuit's face,</p>
<p>Of a thousand thoughts, trace after trace,</p>
<p>Like swift cloud shadows, each other chase.</p>
<p>One instant, his fingers grasp his knife,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>
<p>For a last vain struggle for cherished life,&mdash;</p>
<p>The next, he hurls the blade away,</p>
<p>And kneels at his altar's foot to pray;</p>
<p>Over his beads his fingers stray,</p>
<p>And he kisses the cross, and calls aloud</p>
<p class="i1">On the Virgin and her Son;</p>
<p>For terrible thoughts his memory crowd</p>
<p class="i1">Of evils seen and done,&mdash;</p>
<p>Of scalps brought home by his savage flock</p>

</div><div class="stanza">

<p class="i1">Exultingly before their eyes,&mdash;</p>
<p>Till cleft and torn by shot and blow,</p>
<p class="i1">Defiant still, he dies."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Kennebec, turning grandly to the eastward,
five miles below pours over the falls of Skowhegan,
descending twenty-eight feet upon rough ledges,
having a picturesque island ending at the crest of
the cataract, with the stream beyond compressed
within the high, rocky walls of a canyon. Here are
numerous factories and a population of six thousand.
Eighteen miles beyond, the river, having resumed
its southern course, tumbles down the Taconic Falls
at Waterville, a town of seven thousand people and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
extensive cotton-mills, also having the Colby College
of the Baptist Church where General Benjamin F.
Butler was a student. Farther down the Kennebec
are the ruins of Fort Halifax, near the confluence
with Sebasticook River, draining various lakes to the
northeastward. This was one of the chain of forts
built in the middle eighteenth century to defend the
Puritan coast towns from French and Indian raids,
and large Indian settlements formerly occupied the
broad intervales in the neighborhood. Twenty miles
below Waterville is Augusta, the Maine capital, situate
at the head of navigation, the city being beautifully
located upon the high hills and their slopes
bordering the river. Just above the town is the
great Kennebec dam, built at an expense of $300,000
to make an admirable water-power, and rising
fifteen feet above high water. Here are over ten
thousand people, among whom lived for many years
James G. Blaine, who died in 1893. There are
large textile factories giving employment to the inhabitants,
and the chief building is the State House,
of white granite, fronted by a Doric colonnade,
standing upon a high hill and surmounted by a
graceful dome. Across the Kennebec is the fine
granite Insane Hospital in extensive ornamental
grounds, while down by the bank are the remains of
Fort Western, built as a defensive outpost in 1754,
being then surrounded by palisaded outworks garnished
with towers. It was here that Benedict Arnold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
gathered his expedition against Quebec in 1775,
going up the Kennebec, crossing the border wilderness
and enduring the greatest hardships, before he
appeared like an apparition with his army of gaunt
heroes under the walls of that fortress.</p>

<p>Below Augusta is the quiet town of Hallowell, and
then Gardiner, and beyond, the Kennebec spreads
out in the broad expanse of Merry Meeting Bay,
where it receives the Androscoggin coming up from
the southwest. Along here are seen to perfection
the two great crops of these rivers&mdash;the lumber and
the ice. The largest icehouses in existence line
the banks, and the prolific ice-crop of these pure
waters, thus gathered by the millions of tons, is
shipped by sea from Gardiner and Bath throughout
the coast and over to Europe. The people seem to
saw logs all summer and cut ice all winter. The
river next passes Bath, formerly a great ship-building
port, and still doing much work in the construction
of steel vessels, though the population has rather
decreased of late years. The town, with its front of
shipyards and kindred industries, fringes the western
river-bank for two or three miles, and on either hand
the rocky shores slope steeply down to the water. A
clergyman from Salem bought this domain in 1660
from Damarine, the old sachem of Sagadahoc, whom
the whites called Robin Hood, but the place did not
grow much until after the Revolution, when extensive
shipbuilding began. It is about thirteen miles from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the sea, the Kennebec entering the Atlantic through
Sheepscott Bay, an irregular indentation of the coast
studded with many attractive islands. At Bath, more
than anywhere else in New England, has been practically
realized Longfellow's invocation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Build me straight, O worthy master!</p>
<p class="i1">Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel,</p>
<p>That shall laugh at all disaster,</p>
<p class="i1">And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="center p2">ANCIENT PEMAQUID.</p>

<p>Eastward from the Kennebec the long peninsula
of Pemaquid Point stretches to the sea, between
John's Bay and Muscongus Bay, and far out beyond
it, off the western entrance to Penobscot Bay, is
Monhegan, the most famous island on the New England
coast. It is twelve miles off the Point, and the
surface rises into highlands. Monhegan appears
upon the earliest charts made by the first navigators,
Champlain naming it in 1604 and Weymouth coming
there the next year to trade with the Indians of
Pemaquid before he ascended the great river, which
he said was called Norumbega, and about which there
was long so much mystery and wonder in Europe.
Smith was there in 1614, it was colonized in 1618,
in 1621 it sent succor to the starving Pilgrims at
Plymouth, and in 1626 two proprietors bought the
island for £50. It had a stirring colonial history,
and on account of its location its grand flashing beacon-light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
is a landmark for the mariners coasting
along Maine or entering the Penobscot. Yet it has
barely a hundred people to-day, mostly fishermen,
though its isolation has manifest advantages, for it is
said to have no public officials, and to be the one
place where there are no taxes. In fair sight of each
other, over the blue sea, are the highlands of Monhegan
and the rocks and coves of Pemaquid Point,
the great stronghold of early British colonial power
in Maine. Rival French and English grants covered
the whole of Maine, and at the outstart the English
took possession of the Kennebec, and the French of
the Penobscot. The colonists were in almost constant
enmity, as also were the Indians upon the two
rivers, the warfare continuing a hundred and fifty
years, until after the Revolution. The English made
Pemaquid Point their fortified outpost, while the
French established old Fort Pentagoet, afterwards
Castine, as their stronghold on the Penobscot. The
earliest settlement at the mouth of the Kennebec was
made in 1607 by Chief Justice George Popham, who
came there with one hundred and twenty colonists in
two ships, named the "Mary and John" and the
"Gift of God." They founded Fort St. George, and
built the first vessel on the Kennebec, the "Virginia"
of thirty tons, but Popham dying the next
year, they became discouraged and abandoned the
colony.</p>

<p>Pemaquid saw constant disturbances. Weymouth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
when he traded there in 1605, kidnapped several
Indians and carried them back to England. The
fierce Abenaquis from Penobscot Bay attacked the
place in 1615 and massacred all the Wawenock
Indians who lived there. Then the old Sagamore
Samoset appeared upon the scene, the same who welcomed
the Pilgrims to Plymouth. He lived near
Pemaquid, and told them at Plymouth his home was
distant "a daye's sayle with a great wind, and five
dayes by land." He sold Pemaquid to the first English
colonists in 1625 by deed, his sign manual upon
it being a bended bow with an arrow fitted to the
string, ready to shoot. They saw the strategic importance
of the place and built a small fort in 1630.
Then a pirate came along, captured and plundered
the settlement, holding it until an armed ship from
Massachusetts recaptured it in 1635, the pirate being
hanged. Then stronger forts were built, and Fort
Charles was constructed in 1674, but in King Philip's
War the French and Indians attacked it, driving out
the people, who escaped by boats to Monhegan.
Again, in 1689, the Abenaquis from old Pentagoet,
under their chief Madockawando, captured it with
great slaughter, destroying the works. The English
in 1693 once more took possession, this time building
a stone fort regarded as impregnable and said to be
the finest work then in New England. French
frigates soon attacked it and were repulsed, and its
fame was great throughout the colonies. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
French and the Abenaquis were bound to defeat its
possessors, and in 1696 the former with a fleet and
the latter under Baron de Castine again attacked,
and captured it with a horrible massacre, all the
survivors being carried into captivity. The English
did not reoccupy the Point for some time, but in
1724 they repaired the ruined fort, and deciding that
a place of so much importance must be held at all
hazards, in 1730 Fort Frederick, the great defensive
work of Pemaquid, was built, and a town grew
around it. The French and Indians made unsuccessful
attacks in 1745, and again in 1747. Thus fiercely
raged the battle between the rival possessors of the
Penobscot and the Kennebec, and the ruins of this
last and greatest work, Fort Frederick, have been
the place where for years the antiquarians have been
delving for relics, much as they do in Pompeii. It
was an extensive exterior fortress with an interior
citadel, located upon a slope rising from a rocky
shore and controlling the approach from the sea. A
high rock in the southeastern angle, forming part of
the magazine, is the most prominent portion of the
ruins. A martello tower stood in front on the sea-beach,
but is now pulverized into broken fragments.
A graveyard, several paved streets, and cellars of
buildings have been disclosed. The final destruction
of Fort Frederick was by the Americans in the
Revolution, to prevent its becoming a British stronghold,
and its last battle was in 1814, when a force in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
boats from a British frigate attacked the Point, but
were repulsed with heavy loss. Its present condition
is thus described in the mournful ballad of <i>Pemaquid</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"The restless sea resounds along the shore,</p>
<p class="i1">The light land breeze flows outward with a sigh,</p>
<p>And each to each seems chanting evermore</p>
<p class="i1">A mournful memory of the days gone by.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Here, where they lived, all holy thoughts revive,</p>

<p class="i1">Silent they speak from out the shadowy past."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="center p2">THE PENOBSCOT.</p>

<p>The peninsula between the Kennebec and the Penobscot
River is traversed by a railway route through
the forests of Lincoln and Knox Counties, named after
two famous Revolutionary Generals. It crosses the
Sheepscott and St. George Rivers and skirts the
head of Muscongus Bay, amid a goodly crop of rocks,
passing Wiscasset, Damariscotta (near the lake of that
name, which got its title from the old Indian chief,
Damarine), Waldeboro' and Thomaston to Rockland,
upon the deeply indented Owl's Head Bay looking
out upon the Penobscot. This peninsula is serrated
by more of the numerous bays and havens of which
Whittier sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"From gray sea-fog, from icy drift,</p>
<p class="i1">From peril and from pain,</p>
<p>The homebound fisher greets thy lights,</p>
<p class="i1">O hundred-harbored Maine!"</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>We have now come to the chief river of Maine,
the Penobscot, draining the larger portion of its
enormous forests, and emptying into the ocean
through a vast estuary, which is the greatest of the
many bays upon this rugged coast. Three centuries
ago this was the fabulous river of Norumbega,
enclosing unknown treasures and a mysterious city,
as weirdly described by the Spaniards and Portuguese,
who were the first visitors to the prolific fishing-grounds
of America. At that time Europe knew
of no river that was its equal, and no bay with such
broad surface and enormous tidal flow. Hence many
were the tales about wonderful Norumbega. The
Penobscot estuary, with its connecting waters, embraces
an archipelago said to contain five hundred
islands, making a large portion of the Maine coast,
which in many respects is the most remarkable in the
country. It is jagged and uneven, seamed with deep
inlets and guarded by craggy headlands, projecting
far out into the ocean, while between are myriads of
rocky and in many cases romantic islands. This
coast is composed almost wholly of granites, syenites
and other metamorphic rocks that have been deeply
scraped and grooved ages ago by the huge glacier
which, descending from Greenland and extending far
into the sea, was of such vast thickness and ponderous
weight as to plough out these immense valleys
and ravines in the granite floor. The chief of these
ridges and furrows lie almost north and south, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
the Maine shore-line is a series of long, rocky peninsulas
separated by deep and elongated bays, having
within and beyond them myriads of long islands and
sunken ledges, with the same general southern trend
as the mainland. Large rocks and boulders are also
strewn over the land and upon the bottom of the
sea, where they have been left by the receding glacier.
These fragments are piled in enormous quantities
in various places, many of the well-known fishing-banks,
such as George's Shoals, being glacial
deposits. These rocks and sunken ledges are covered
with marine animals, making the favorite food
of many of the most important food-fishes. The Penobscot
from its source to the sea flows about three
hundred miles. The wide bay and wedge-shape of
the lower river, by gathering so large a flow of tidal
waters, which are suddenly compressed at the Narrows
just below Bucksport, make a rapidly-rushing
tide, and an ebb and flow rising seventeen feet at
Bangor, sixteen miles above. When Weymouth
came in 1605 he set up a cross near where Belfast
now stands, on the western shore of the bay, and
took possession for England, and he marvelled greatly
at what he saw, writing home that "many who had
been travellers in sundry countries and in most
famous rivers affirmed them not comparable to this&mdash;the
most beautiful, rich, large, secure harboring river
that the world affordeth." The Indians whom he
found on its shores were the Tarratines, an Abenaquis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
tribe, who inhabited all that part of Maine. The
Jesuit missionaries early came among them from
Canada, and they were firm friends of the French.
They called the great river Pentagoet, or "the stream
where there are rapids," while its shores were the
Penobscot, meaning "where the land is covered with
rocks."</p>

<p class="center p2">PENTAGOET AND CASTINE.</p>

<p>Pierre du Guast, Sieur de Monts, as a reward for
his faithfulness, was given, in 1602, by the French
King Henry of Navarre, a grant of all America
from the 40th to the 46th parallels of latitude. He
came out and founded a colony on Passamaquoddy
Bay, and finding that the Indians called the region
Acadie, or the "land of plenty," he named his domain
Acadia. The French afterwards extended their
explorations westward along the Maine coast, claiming
under this grant, and this was the source of the
many subsequent conflicts. Coming into Penobscot
Bay, they made their outpost and stronghold upon
the peninsula of Pentagoet on its eastern shore,
marking the western limit of Acadia. Their famous
old Fort Pentagoet, from which the French and Indian
raiders for more than a century swooped down
upon the English border settlements, is now the pleasant
summer resort of Castine. Originally, the English
from Plymouth established a trading-post there,
but the French captured it, and then in the French
religious conflicts it was alternately held by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Catholic and Huguenot chieftains sent out to rule
Acadia. Sometimes pirates took it, and once some
bold Dutchmen came up from New York and were
its captors. But the French held it for a full century,
though repeatedly attacked, until just before
the Revolution, when the English conquered and
held it throughout that war, again seizing it in the
War of 1812. This noted old fort was captured and
scarred in wars resulting in no less than five different
national occupations. The present name is derived
from Baron Castine, who came with his French regiment
to Acadia, and gave Pentagoet its great romance.
He was Vincent, Baron de St. Castine, lord
of Oléron in the French Pyrenees, who arrived in
1667, and inspired by a chivalrous desire to extend
the Catholic religion among the Indians, went into
the wilderness to live among the fierce Tarratines.
As Longfellow tells it in the Student's Tale at <i>The
Wayside Inn</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Baron Castine of St. Castine</p>
<p>Has left his château in the Pyrenees</p>
<p>And sailed across the Western seas."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Pentagoet then was a populous town ruled by the
Sachem Madockawando, and the young Baron, tarrying
there, soon found friends among the Indians.
The sachem had a susceptible daughter, and this
dusky belle, captivated by the courtly graces of the
handsome Baron, fell in love:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"For man is fire, and woman is tow,</p>
<p>And the Somebody comes and begins to blow."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The usual results followed, so that it was not long
before&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Lo! the young Baron of St. Castine,</p>
<p class="i1">Swift as the wind is, and as wild,</p>
<p>Has married a dusky Tarratine,</p>
<p class="i1">Has married Madocawando's child!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>This marriage made him one of the tribe, and he
soon became their leader. The restless and warlike
Indians almost worshipped the chivalrous young
Frenchman; he was their apostle, and led them in
repeated raids against their English and Indian foes.
But ultimately tiring of this roving life in the forests,
he returned to "his château in the Pyrenees,"
taking his Indian bride along. They were welcomed
with surprise and admiration:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Down in the village day by day</p>
<p>The people gossip in their way,</p>
<p>And stare to see the Baroness pass</p>
<p>On Sunday morning to early mass;</p>
<p>And when she kneeleth down to pray,</p>
<p>They wonder, and whisper together, and say,</p>
<p>'Surely this is no heathen lass!'</p>
<p>And in course of time they learn to bless</p>
<p>The Baron and the Baroness.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"And in course of time the curate learns</p>
<p>A secret so dreadful, that by turns</p>
<p>He is ice and fire, he freezes and burns.</p>
<p>The Baron at confession hath said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>
<p>That though this woman be his wife,</p>
<p>He hath wed her as the Indians wed,</p>
<p>He hath bought her for a gun and a knife!"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then there was trouble, but it seems to have been
soon cured by a Christian wedding:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The choir is singing the matin song,</p>
<p>The doors of the church are opened wide,</p>
<p>The people crowd, and press and throng,</p>
<p>To see the bridegroom and the bride.</p>
<p>They enter and pass along the nave;</p>
<p>They stand upon the father's grave;</p>
<p>The bells are ringing soft and slow;</p>
<p>The living above and the dead below</p>
<p>Give their blessing on one and twain;</p>
<p>The warm wind blows from the hills of Spain,</p>
<p>The birds are building, the leaves are green,</p>
<p>And Baron Castine of St. Castine</p>
<p>Hath come at last to his own again."</p>
</div></div>

<p>In course of time the son of the Baron by his Tarratine
princess became chief of the tribe and ruled it
until in a raid in 1721 he was captured by the English
and taken to Boston. When brought before the Council
there for trial he wore his French uniform, and was
accused of attending an Abenaqui council-fire. He
sturdily replied, "I am an Abenaqui by my mother;
all my life has been passed among the nation that has
made me chief and commander over it. I could not
be absent from a council where the interests of my
brethren were to be discussed. The dress I now wear
is one becoming my rank and birth as an officer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
the Most Christian King of France, my master."
After being held prisoner several months, he was released,
and finally also returned to the ancestral
château in the Pyrenees. His lineal descendants are
still at the head of the tribe, which has dwindled to
almost nothing. Pentagoet honoring the memory, afterwards
became Castine. Remains of the old fort
and batteries are preserved, and a miniature earthwork
commands the harbor. The Tarratines and all
the Abenaqui tribes were firm friends of the Americans
in the Revolution; there are remnants of them
in Canada, but the best preserved is the Indian settlement
on Indian Island, in the Penobscot River,
above Bangor. For fealty in the Revolution they
were given a reservation, where a few hundred descendants
now live in a village around their church,
having a town hall and schools, with books printed in
their own Abenaqui language, and ruled by their
tribal officials. This last remnant of a warlike nation
with such an interesting history gets a modest subsistence
by catching fish and lobsters, and rafting logs
on their great river of Norumbega.</p>

<p class="center p2">ASCENDING THE PENOBSCOT.</p>

<p>The Penobscot drains an immense territory covered
with pine, spruce and hemlock forests. Two
hundred millions of feet of lumber will be floated
down it in a single season. Its bold western bay
shore rises into the Camden Mountains, and both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
sides of the bay were embraced for thirty miles in
the Muscongus Patent, a grant of King George I.
which came to the colonial Governor Samuel Waldo,
of Massachusetts, and afterwards, by descent through
his wife, to General Henry Knox. Thus Knox became
the Patroon of Penobscot Bay, building a
palace at Thomaston, where he lived in baronial state
and spent so much money in princely hospitality that
he bankrupted himself and almost ruined his Revolutionary
compatriot, General Lincoln, who became
involved with him. On this western shore, Rockland,
with nine thousand people, is a town of sea-captains,
fishermen and lime-burners, its rocks making
the best lime of the district, and a hundred kilns
illuminating the hills at night. Adjacent are Dix
Island, and to the southward Vinalhaven Island, producing
fine granites shipped abroad for building. To
the northward is Camden, under the shadow of
Mount Megunticook, its two peaks rising fourteen
hundred feet above the harbor. Out in front is an
archipelago of pretty islands, the chief being "the
insular town of Islesboro," stretching about thirteen
miles along the centre of Penobscot Bay, its ten square
miles of irregular contour having of late developed
into a region of cottages built in all the pleasant
places and making a very popular resort. To the
northeastward the massive Blue Hill stands up an
isolated guardian behind the peninsula of Castine,
where the attractive white houses are spread over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the broad and sloping point enclosing its deep harbor,
and its church-spire rises sharply among the
trees. In the eastern archipelago of Penobscot Bay
are the Fox Island group of about one hundred and
fifty islands, and the larger islands of North Haven
and Vinalhaven are to the southward, beyond which
are the shores of Cape Rosier, making the eastern
border of the bay, while through a vista looms up the
distant Isle au Haut, an outer guardian upon the
ocean's edge. At the eastern horizon behind the
cape rise the hazy, bisected, round-topped peaks of
Mount Desert, thirty miles away.</p>

<p>Belfast is another maritime town of Penobscot Bay
on a deeply-indented harbor under the shadow of the
Camden Hills, the place where Weymouth in 1605
landed and set up the cross. It was settled and
named by Scotch-Irish Presbyterians in 1770, and it
looks out pleasantly across the broad bay upon Castine.
Above are Searsport and Fort Point, with the ruins
of the colonial Fort Pownall, and then the river is
quickly contracted into the Narrows, where the swift
tides run at Bucksport. The upper river is sinuous
and picturesque, and at the head of navigation, sixty
miles from the sea, is Bangor, with twenty thousand
people, finely located on commanding hills, its chief
industry being the sawing and shipment of lumber.
The sawmills line the shores and the log-booms extend
for miles along the river. The chief assembly
room of the city is the Norumbega Hall, and there also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
is a Theological Seminary of high standing. It is said
that the settlement, which had languished during the
Revolution, in 1791 ordered Rev. Seth Noble, its
representative in the Legislature, to have it incorporated
under the name of Sunbury, but he, being very
fond of the old tune of Bangor, wrote that name inadvertently,
and it thus was given the town. Thirteen
miles northward is Oldtown, another great
gathering-place for logs and sawmills, and having
the Tarratine Indian settlement on the island in mid-stream.
The Penobscot River receives various tributaries
above, which drain the extensive northern
forests of Maine&mdash;the Piscataquis coming from the
westward, the Mattawamkeag from the northeast,
and the Seboois. The main stream rises near the
western Canada border of Maine and flows eastward
into Chesuncook Lake, whence its general course to
the sea is southeast and south. The river thus drains
a broad basin, embracing myriads of lakes in the
northern Maine forests, and it has an enormous
water-power, as yet only partially utilized.</p>

<p class="center p2">MOUNT DESERT ISLAND.</p>

<p>Beyond the archipelago, eastward from the Penobscot
estuary, is the noted island, presenting the only
land along the Atlantic coast where high mountains
are in close proximity to the sea. It appears to-day
just at it did to Champlain when he first saw it in
September, 1604, and, being impressed with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
craggy, desolate summits, named it the <i>Isle des Monts
déserts</i>, the "Island of Desert Mountains." He then
wrote of it, "The land is very high, intersected by
passes, appearing from the sea like seven or eight
mountains ranged near each other; the summits of
the greater part of these are bare of trees, because
they are nothing but rocks." In approaching from
the southwestward by sea, the distant gray recumbent
elephant that has been lying at the horizon
gradually resolves its two rounded summits into different
peaks; but the finer approach is rather from
the northward by the railway route, which is the one
most travelled. The quick advance of the train unfolds
the separate mountain peaks, and the whole
range is well displayed, there being apparently eight
eminences, but upon coming nearer, others seem to
detach themselves. Green Mountain is the highest,
rising over fifteen hundred feet, near the eastern side,
while Western Mountain terminates the range on the
other side, and at the eastern verge is Newport
Mountain, having the fashionable settlement of Bar
Harbor at its northern base. There are several
beautiful lakes high up among these peaks, the chief
being Eagle Lake. Beech and Dog Mountains have
peculiarities of outline, and a wider opening between
two ponderous peaks shows where the sea has driven-in
the strange and deeply carved inlet of Somes'
Sound, six miles from the southern side, to almost
bisect the island. Hung closely upon the coast of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Maine, in Frenchman Bay, this noted island, the
ancient Indian Pemetic, is about fifteen miles long,
of varying width, and covers a hundred square
miles. It has many picturesque features, its mountains,
which run in roughly parallel ridges north and
south, separated by narrow trough-like valleys, displaying
thirteen distinct eminences, the eastern summits
being the highest, and terminating generally at
or near the water's edge on that side in precipitous
cliffs, with the waves dashing against their bases.
Upon the southeastern coast, fronting the ocean, as a
fitting termination to the grand scenery of these
mountain-ranges, the border of the Atlantic is a
galaxy of stupendous cliffs, the two most remarkable
being of national fame&mdash;Schooner Head and Great
Head&mdash;the full force of old ocean driving against
their massive rocky buttresses. Schooner Head has
a surface of white rock on its face, which when seen
from the sea is fancied to resemble the sails of a small
vessel, apparently moving in front of the giant cliff.
Great Head, two miles southward, is an abrupt projecting
mass of rock, the grim and bold escarpment
having deep gashes across the base, evidently worn
by the waves. It is the highest headland on the
island. Castle Head is a perpendicular columned
mass, appearing like a colossal, castellated doorway,
flanked by square towers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig270" id="fig270"></a>
<img src="images/i301.jpg" width="550" height="390" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>Along the Coast at Bar Harbor, Me.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For more than a century after Champlain first
looked upon this island, the French made ineffectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
attempts at settlement, but it was not until 1761 that
any one succeeded in establishing a permanent home.
Then old Abraham Somes, a hardy mariner from
Cape Ann, came along, and entering the Sound that
bears his name, settled on the shore, and his descendant
is said to still keep the inn at Somesville on the
very spot of his earliest colonization. After the little
colony was planted, the cultivation of the cranberry
and the gathering of blueberries kept the people
alive, these being almost the only food-products raised
in the moderate allowance of soil allotted the island.
The population grew but slowly, though artists and
summer saunterers came this way, and about 1860 it
began to attract the pleasure-seekers. When the
island, in its early government, was divided into
towns, the eastern portion was called, with a little
irony, Eden. Bar Harbor, an indentation of Frenchman
Bay, having a bar uncovered at low tide, which
named it, being easy of access, the village of East
Eden on its shores became the fashionable resort. It
has a charming outlook over the bay, with its fleets
of gaily-bannered yachts and canoes and the enclosing
Porcupine Islands, but there is not much natural
attractiveness. It is a town of summer hotels and
boarding-houses, built upon what was a treeless plain,
the outskirts being a galaxy of cottages, many of
great pretensions. Here will congregate ten to
twenty thousand visitors in the season, and Bar
Harbor has become one of the most fashionable resorts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
on the Atlantic coast. Its bane, however, is
the fog, a frequent sojourner in the summer, though
even fogs, in their way, have charms. There are
days that it lies in banks upon the sea, with only occasional
incursions upon the shore, when under a
shining sun the mist creeps over the water and finally
blots out the landscape. But light breezes and warm
sunshine then soon disperse it and the view reappears.
The fog-rifts are wonderful picture-makers.
Sometimes the mist obscures the sea and lower shores
of the attendant islands, leaving a narrow fringe of
tree-tops resting against the horizon, as if suspended
in mid-air. Often a yacht sails through the fog,
looking like a colossal ghost, when suddenly its sails
flash out in the sunlight like huge wings. Thus the
mist paints dissolving views, so that the fogs of
Mount Desert become an attraction, and occasionally
through them appears the famed mirage which Whittier
describes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Sometimes in calms of closing day</p>
<p>They watched the spectral mirage play;</p>
<p>Saw low, far islands looming tall and high,</p>
<p>And ships, with upturned keels, sail like a sea the sky."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Somes Sound has off its entrance on the southern
side of Mount Desert, the group of Cranberry
Islands with a lighthouse on Baker's Island, the
outermost of the cluster. These make a picturesque
outlook for the summer settlements which have grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
around the spacious indentations of North East Harbor
and South West Harbor, on either side of the entrance
to the Sound. To the eastward is another indentation
in the southern coast, Seal Harbor, also a
popular resort, having one of the finest beaches on
the island. The five high rocky Porcupine Islands
partially enclosing Bar Harbor get their names from
their bristling crests of pines and spruces, one of
them, the Bald Porcupine, having some stupendous
cliffs. The visits to the cliffs along the shores and
the ascent of the mountains are the chief excursions
from Bar Harbor. Four miles southward is the summit
of Green Mountain, its sides being rugged, and
the charming Eagle Lake to the westward nestling
among the mountain peaks. The view from the top
is fine, over the deeply-cut Somes Sound, penetrating
almost through the island, and the grand expanse
of Maine coast, seen, with its many bays and islands,
stretching from the Penobscot northeast to Quoddy
Head. All around to the southward and eastward
spreads the open ocean bounded by the horizon, and
like a speck, to the south-southeast, twenty miles
away, is the lighthouse upon the bleak crag known as
Mount Desert Rock, far out at sea, the most remote
beacon, in its distant isolation, upon the New England
coast.</p>

<p class="center p2">ENTERING THE MARITIME PROVINCES.</p>

<p>The Maine coast beyond Mount Desert has more
deep harbors and long peninsulas. Here are Englishman's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
Bay, Machias Bay, Cutler Harbor and others,
and finally Passamaquoddy Bay, opening into the
Bay of Fundy. Grand Manan Island lies off this
Bay, the first land of the British Maritime Provinces,
twenty-two miles long and distant about nine miles
from the coast of Maine, the frowning yet attractive
precipices of its western verge rising four hundred
feet. Over opposite in Maine, as the strait between
the two narrows, are dark, storm-worn crags, which
end with a promontory bearing a conspicuously red
and white-striped lighthouse tower. This is the termination
of the coast of Maine and of the United
States at Quoddy Head, and the entrance to St.
Croix River to the northward, the boundary between
New England and the Canadian Province of New
Brunswick. Quoddy Head is a long peninsula, with
Campobello Island directly in front. Just beyond is
another peninsula, bearing a village of white cottages,
rising on the slopes of a high rounded hill having a
church with a tall spire perched upon its pinnacle.
This is Lubec, the easternmost town of the United
States. Out in front upon Campobello lived for
many years the eccentric old sailor, William Fitzwilliam
Owen, a retired British Admiral, who built there
on the rocks a regulation "quarter-deck" of a man-of-war,
whereon he solemnly promenaded in full
uniform and issued orders to a mythical crew.
Finally he died, and as he had desired, was buried
by candlelight in the churchyard of the little chapel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
he had built on the island. Campobello is now a
summer resort, with numerous hotels and cottages.
All these waters are filled with wicker-work fish-weirs,
wherein are caught the herring supplying the
Eastport sardine-packing establishments. This is
another town of white houses on an island adjoining
the mainland, having a little fort and a prominent
display of the sardine-factories in front, with a background
of fir-clad hills in Maine.</p>

<p>St. Croix River falling into Passamaquoddy Bay
is, for its whole length of one hundred and twenty-five
miles, the national boundary. Upon Neutral Island
near its mouth was made the first unfortunate settlement
of Acadie by the Sieur De Monts in 1604. He
named both the island and river St. Croix because,
just above, various bends of the river and its branches
form a cross. The St. Croix discharges the noted
Schoodic Lakes far up in the forest on the boundary,
which have become a favorite resort of sportsmen
and anglers. It brings down many logs, and the
sawmills have made the prosperity of the twin towns
of Calais and St. Stephen on its banks, which represent
the two nations, and being very friendly, are
connected by a bridge. Upon a peninsula near the
mouth of the river is St. Andrews, in New Brunswick,
which like most other places in this pleasant
region is developing into a summer resort. When
De Monts came and landed, he named the country
Acadie because that was what the Indians called it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
The Indians, however, in pronouncing it made the
sound like "a-quoddy," and from this is derived Passamaquoddy,
the name of the bay into which the St.
Croix flows, the word <i>Pesmo-acadie</i> meaning the
"pollock place of plenty," as these fish were prolific
there. It is at North Perry in Maine, a village on
the western verge of the bay and between Eastport
and Calais, that the Government has erected the
obelisk marking the forty-fifth parallel of north latitude,
midway between the equator and the pole.</p>

<p>The Canadian Province of New Brunswick into
which we have now come in the journey "Down
East" is described as "a region of ships, of pine
trees, salmon, deals, hemlock bark and most excellent
red granite." The first impression upon entering it
is made by the highways, where the change from the
United States to the British methods is shown in the
reversal of the usual "rule of the road," from right
to left. The vehicles all "keep to the left," and
hence the appropriate proverb:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The rule of the road is a parodox quite,</p>
<p class="i1">In driving your carriage along,</p>
<p>If you keep to the left you are sure to go right,</p>
<p class="i1">If you keep to the right you go wrong."</p>
</div></div>

<p>We have also got into the region of the Bay of Fundy,
the Portuguese <i>Bayo Fondo</i>, or "deep bay," with its
high tides. This huge inlet of the Atlantic is about
one hundred and seventy miles long, thrust up between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, stretching from
thirty to fifty miles wide between them. Its eastern
extremity branches into two arms, the northern,
Chignecto Bay, about thirty miles long, and the
southern, Minas Channel, opening into the Minas
Basin. Besides the St. Croix, this bay also receives
St. John River, the greatest in the Maritime Provinces.
The bay is remarkable for its tides, which
are probably the highest in the world, owing to the concentration
of the tidal wave by the approach of the
shores and the gradual shoaling of the bottom. The
very moderate tides of the Massachusetts coast increase
to about nine feet rise at the mouth of the
Kennebec. The configuration of the Maine coast to
the northeast further increases this to fifteen or
twenty feet rise at Eastport. Beyond this the Bay
of Fundy is a complete <i>cul-de-sac</i>, and the farther
the tide gets in the higher it rises. In St. John harbor
it becomes twenty-one to twenty-three feet, and
farther up it is greater, in Minas Basin the rise reaching
forty feet, and in Chignecto Bay, near the upper
extremity, sixty feet. These tremendous tides cause
peculiar phenomena; they make the rivers seem to
actually run up-hill at times, while the tidal "bore"
or wall of water, which is the advance of the flood,
moves up the streams and across the extensive mudflats
with the speed of a railway train, often catching
the unsuspecting who may be wandering over them.
The elaborate wharves made for boat-landings are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
built up like three-story houses, with different floor-levels,
so as to enable the vessels to get alongside at
all stages of the tide.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE CITY OF ST. JOHN.</p>

<p>Upon St. John's Day, June 24, 1604, De Monts
piloted by Champlain, coasting along the monotonous
forest-clad shores of New Brunswick, sailed into the
mouth of the River St. John, and named it in memory
of the day of its discovery. Off the entrance is
Partridge Island, now surmounted by a lighthouse and
what is said to be the most powerful fog-siren in the
world, whose hoarse blasts can be heard thirty miles
away, a necessity in this region, where fogs prevail
so generally. From the Negro Head, a high hill on
the western shore, a breakwater extends across the
harbor entrance, and within is the city covering the
hills running down to the water as the inner harbor
curves toward the westward. Timber being the
great export, lumber-piles and timber-ships fill the
wharves, sawdust floats on the water, and vessels
are anchored out in the stream loading deals from
lighters.</p>

<p>De Monts found some Micmac Indians at St. John,
but he did not remain there, and it was not until
1634 when Claude de St. Estienne, Sieur de la Tour,
a Huguenot who had been granted Acadie by King
Charles I. of England, came out with his son and
built a fort at the mouth of St. John River, the son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Charles de la Tour for some years afterwards holding
it and enjoying a lucrative trade. The French King,
however, had made a rival grant of Acadie, which
had come into possession of Charles de Menon, Sieur
d'Aulnay Charnisay, who made a settlement at Annapolis
Royal over in Nova Scotia, where De Monts
took the remnant of his unfortunate colony from St.
Croix River. D'Aulnay envied La Tour his prosperity,
provoked a quarrel, accused him of treason,
and finally came over and blockaded the mouth of
the St. John with six ships. La Tour, anticipating
this attack, had implored aid from the Huguenots in
France, and they sent out the ship "Clement" with
one hundred and forty men, which remained in the
offing. One cloudy night La Tour and his wife
slipped out of the harbor on the ebb tide in a boat
and got aboard the ship, which carried them to Boston,
where additional help was sought. Old Cotton
Mather records that the Puritans hearkened unto him
and searched the Scriptures to see if there was Divine
sanction for interference in a French quarrel.
They found sundry texts that were interpreted as
possibly forbidding such action, but they nevertheless
concluded "it was as lawful for them to give La
Tour succor as it was for Joshua to aid the Gideonites
against the rest of the Canaanites, or for Jehoshaphat
to aid Jehoram against Moab." So they
quickly started five Massachusetts ships that way,
with which La Tour raised the blockade and drove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
D'Aulnay across the Bay of Fundy back to his own
post of Annapolis Royal. D'Aulnay did not rest
content under defeat, however, but two years later
again attacked the fort. Two spies, who had gained
entrance in the disguise of monks, informed him La
Tour was absent, the fort being under command of
his wife. Expecting easy victory, he ordered an
assault, but was met by Madame La Tour at the head
of the little garrison and defeated with heavy loss.
He awaited another opportunity, and in 1647 when
La Tour was away on a trading expedition, leaving
but a small force, he again attacked. During three
days his assaults were repulsed, but a treacherous
sentry admitted the enemy within the fort. Even
then the brave woman fought with such intrepidity
that she was given her own terms of capitulation.
No sooner had she surrendered, however, than
D'Aulnay violated his agreement and hanged the
garrison, compelling Madame La Tour to witness it
with a halter around her neck. This so preyed upon
her mind that a few days afterwards she died of a
broken heart. Whittier has woven this story into
his romantic poem <i>St. John</i>, describing La Tour returning
to the fort and expecting his wife's greeting,
but instead he found its walls shattered and the buildings
burnt. A priest appearing, La Tour seizes him,
demanding an explanation, and thus spoke the priest:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"'No wolf, Lord of Estienne, has ravaged thy hall,</p>
<p>But thy red-handed rival, with fire, steel and ball!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>
<p>On an errand of mercy, I hitherward came,</p>
<p>While the walls of thy castle yet spouted with flame.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"'Pentagoet's dark vessels were moored in the bay,</p>
<p>Grim sea-lions roaring aloud for their prey.'</p>
<p>'But what of my lady?' cried Charles of Estienne:</p>
<p>'On the shot-crumbled turret, thy lady was seen:</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"'Half-veiled in the smoke-cloud, her hand grasped thy pennon,</p>
<p>While her dark tresses swayed in the hot breath of cannon!</p>
<p>But woe to the heretic, evermore woe!</p>
<p>When the son of the Church and the Cross is his foe!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"'In the track of the shell, in the path of the ball,</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"'Of its sturdy defenders, thy lady alone</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"'Alas for thy lady! No service from thee</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>La Tour returned, but hardly in the manner justifying
the revenge indicated in the poem. D'Aulnay
died shortly afterwards, whereupon La Tour recaptured
his fort and domain in 1653, but not at the
head of an army, diplomatically accomplishing his
victory by marrying D'Aulnay's widow. This post
was known as Fort La Tour until the British conquest
in the eighteenth century, when it was changed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
to Fort Frederick. It then became a fishing station,
and was plundered in the Revolution. Afterwards,
in 1783, about ten thousand exiled tories from the
United States were landed there, this being the
"Landing of the Loyalists" commemorated on May
18th as the founding of St. John, the charter dating
from that day in 1785. Benedict Arnold was one of
these refugees, he living in St. John for several years
from 1786. A Monument in King Square commemorates
the landing of the loyalists and the grant of
the charter. Being built largely of wood, the city
suffered from many disastrous fires, the worst being
in June, 1877, when one-third of the place was
burnt, involving a loss of over sixteen hundred
buildings and nearly $30,000,000. St. John rose
from the ruins with great vitality, the new construction
being largely of brick and stone. The population
now exceeds forty thousand.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE RIVER ST. JOHN.</p>

<p>The great curiosity of St. John is the "reversible
cataract" in the river, caused in the gorge just west
of the city by the enormous tides of the Bay of
Fundy. The great river above the city is a wide
estuary, but before entering the harbor it is compressed
into a short, deep and narrow gorge, barely
one hundred and fifty yards wide in some places, and
obstructed by several rocky islets. As this is the
best crossing-place, two bridges are thrown side by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
side over the chasm, one for a railway and the other
for a street, resting upon the limestone cliffs a hundred
feet above the water. As the tide ebbs and
flows, the rushing river currents make the reversible
cataract, almost under the bridges, with the water
pouring down both ways at different tidal stages.
Through this contracted pass the entire current of
the vast St. John valley finds its outlet to the sea.
When the ebb tide quickly empties the harbor below,
the accumulated river waters cannot get into the
gorge fast enough to reduce as rapidly the level of
the broad basin above, and they consequently rush
down, a cataract, swelling sometimes to ten or twelve
feet at the upper entrance to the gorge, and make
whirling, seething rapids below. When the tide turns,
this outflow is gradually checked by the rise in the
harbor, but soon the tremendous incoming flood from
the Bay of Fundy overpowers the river current, fills
up the gorge, and rapidly rising in the gorge rushes
inward to the broad basin, thus making the cataract
fall the other way. Twice every day this ever-changing
contest is fought, and were it not for the
obstruction made by this narrow, rocky gateway,
these enormous tides would rush along in full force
and overflow a large surface of the very low-lying
interior of New Brunswick. The river makes a sharp
bend just at the outlet of the gorge, turning from
south to northeast around a rocky cape protruding
far into the stream; then it broadens out into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
rounded bay, and a short distance beyond sharply
bends again into the harbor of St. John. Vessels are
taken through the gorge at proper tidal stages,
guided by tugs and floating at high speed with the
rushing current. This is one of the most remarkable
exhibitions made of the curious influence of these
enormous Bay of Fundy tides.</p>

<p>The River St. John, flowing out of the vast forests
of Maine, stretches four hundred and fifty miles from
its sources to the sea. The Micmac Indians of its
upper reaches called it Ouangondie, while the Etechemins
of the lower waters and the St. Croix valley
named it Looshtook, or the "Long River." Its
sources interlock in the Maine forests, at two thousand
feet elevation, with those of the Penobscot flowing
south and the Chaudiere flowing north to the St.
Lawrence, near Quebec. At first the St. John flows
northwest, then east and southeast to its Grand Falls,
then by a winding southern course to the Bay of
Fundy. For a long distance its upper waters are the
national boundary between Maine and Canada. It
receives several large tributaries and drains a valley
embracing seventeen millions of acres. The immense
forest wilderness of Maine, wherein are the
sources of these streams, is seven times the size of
the famous "Black Forest" of Germany. Upon
the upper St. John waters are various villages of
French Acadians, the descendants of those who were
driven out of Nova Scotia in the eighteenth century.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
It receives the Allegash, St. Francis, Madawaska,
Grand and St. Leonard's Rivers, and thus comes to
its cataract with augmented waters&mdash;the Grand Falls.
Above, the stream expands into a broad basin, flowing
from which its enormous current is compressed
into a narrow rock-bound canyon, and after running
down a moderate incline suddenly plunges over the
front and sides of an abyss. This is about sixty feet
deep and formed of slate, the water falling into the
cauldron below, and also over the outer ledges in
minor cascades. Then, with lightning rapidity the
foaming current dashes through another canyon of
two hundred and fifty feet width for three-fourths of
a mile, the walls, of dark, rugged rock, being one
hundred and fifty feet high. Within this terrific
chasm there is a descent of sixty feet more, in
which the waters do not rush along as in the rapids
below Niagara, but are actually belched and volleyed
forth, as if shot out of ten thousand great guns,
with enormous boiling masses hurled into the air
and huge waves leaping high against the enclosing
cliffs. This ungovernable fury continues throughout
most of the passage, the stream at times heaping
itself all on one side, and giving brief glimpses of
the rocky bed of the chasm. Finally an immense
frothy cataract flows over into a lower basin, said
to be unfathomable, where the stream becomes
tranquil and then goes along peacefully between
its farther banks. Majestic scenery surrounds these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Grand Falls, there being high mountains in all directions.</p>

<p>Like all great cataracts, this one has its romance
and tragedy. Alongside the final unfathomable basin
rises a towering precipice two hundred feet high, its
perpendicular wall as smooth as glass. Down it the
ancient Micmacs hurled their captives taken in war.
The implacable foes of these Micmacs, as of all the
tribes allied to the French, were the New York Iroquois,
and particularly the Mohawks. Once a party
of Mohawks penetrated all the way to this remote region,
surprising and capturing a Micmac village with
a fearful massacre. One young squaw, who promised
obedience, they spared, because they wanted her
to guide them down the river. She was put in the
foremost canoe, and the fatigued Mohawks lashed
their canoes together to float with the current in the
night, and then went to sleep. The girl was to guide
them to a safe landing above the cataract, so they
could land and next day go around the portage. She
steered them into the mid-stream current instead, and
dropping quietly overboard swam ashore. They
floated to the brink of the cataract, and when its
thunders awoke them, too late for safety, the whole
party were swept over and perished. This was the
last Mohawk invasion of the region. Twenty miles
below, the Tobique River comes into the St. John,
and is regarded as the most picturesque stream in
New Brunswick, being noted for its lumber camps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
and good angling. Here is Andover, a little village
supplying the lumbermen, and also Florenceville and
Woodstock, with busy sawmills. For miles the river
shores are lofty and bold, affording charming scenery.
The Meduxnekeag flows in from the Maine forests,
bringing down many logs, and below the Meduntic
Rapids are passed. Then the Pokiok, its Indian
name meaning the "dreadful place," flows to the St.
John through a sombre and magnificent gorge four
hundred yards long, very deep and only twenty-five
feet wide. The little river, after plunging down a
cataract of forty feet, rushes over the successive
ledges of this remarkable pass until it reaches the
St. John. For a long distance the great river passes
villages originally settled by disbanded British troops
after the Revolution and now peopled by their descendants,
and then it winds through the pastoral
district of Aukpaque, which was held by Americans
within New Brunswick for two years after the Revolution
began, they finally retreating in 1777 over the
border into the wilderness of Maine, and reaching
the coast at Machias. Seven miles below is Frederickton,
the New Brunswick capital, a small city,
quiet and restful, with broad streets lined by old
shade trees, and covering a good deal of level land
adjoining the river. It has a fine Parliament House,
a small but attractive Cathedral, with a spire one
hundred and eighty feet high, and on the hills back
of the town is the University of New Brunswick.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
The Nashwaak River flows in opposite among sawmills
and cotton-mills, and there was the old French
Fort Nashwaak where the Chevalier de Villebon,
who was sent in 1690 to govern Acadie, fixed his
capital (removing it from Annapolis Royal), and used
to fit out expeditions against the Puritans in New
England, they attacking him once in retaliation, but
being beaten off. The St. John passes through a
pleasant intervale below, the garden-spot of the
Province, where at Maugerville was the earliest
English settlement on the river, colonized from New
England in 1763, after the French surrender of
Canada. Then the St. John receives Jemseg River,
the outlet of Grand Lake, where a French fort was
built as early as 1640 and was fought about for
more than a century. This is a deep, slow-winding
stream in a region of perfect repose, having opposite
its outlet Gagetown, a pretty place with a few hundred
people, and said to be the most slumbrous village
of all this sleepy region:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Oh, so drowsy! in a daze,</p>
<p>Sleeping mid the golden haze;</p>
<p>With its one white row of street</p>
<p>Carpeted so green and sweet,</p>
<p>And the loungers smoking, still,</p>
<p>Over gate and window sill;</p>
<p>Nothing coming, nothing going,</p>
<p>Locusts grating, one cock crowing,</p>
<p>Few things moving up or down;</p>
<p>All things drowsy&mdash;Drowsytown!"</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p>The St. John below is much like a broad and placid
lake flowing through a pastoral country, having long
tributary lakes and bays, including the extensive and
attractive Kennebecasis, which is the favorite rural
resort of the St. John people and the scene of their
aquatic sports. The river farther down broadens
into Grand Bay, and then passing the narrow gorge
of the "reversible cataract," makes the expansive
harbor of St. John, and is ultimately swallowed up
by the Bay of Fundy.</p>

<p class="center p2">ANNAPOLIS AND MINAS BASINS.</p>

<p>From St. John River across the Bay of Fundy to
Digby Gut in Nova Scotia is forty-five miles. For
one hundred and thirty miles, the North Mountain
Ridge, elevated six hundred feet, stretches along the
bay upon the Nova Scotia shore, sharply notched
down at Digby Gut, the entrance to Annapolis Basin.
This strait, barely a half-mile wide, is cut two miles
through the mountain ridge, having a tidal current
of six miles an hour, and within is a magnificent
salt-water lake, surrounded by forests sloping up the
hillsides, and one of the pleasantest sheets of water
in the world. It is no wonder that De Monts, when
his colonists abandoned the dreary island in St. Croix
River, sought refuge here, and that his companion,
Baron de Poutrincourt, obtained a grant for the region.
It is one of the most attractive parts of
Acadia, and as the old song has it:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"This is Acadia&mdash;this the land</p>
<p class="i1">That weary souls have sighed for;</p>
<p>This is Acadia&mdash;this the land</p>
<p class="i1">Heroic hearts have died for."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Digby is within the Gut, fronted by a long and
tall wooden wharf that has to deal with fifty feet of
tide, its end being an enormous square timber crib,
built up like a four-story house. The town is noted
for luscious cherries and for "Digby Chickens," the
most prized brand of herrings cured by the "Blue-noses,"
and it has also developed into quite an attractive
watering-place. To the southwestward a
railway runs to Yarmouth, at the western extremity
of Nova Scotia, a small but very busy port, having
steamer lines in various directions. To the northeastward
Annapolis Basin stretches sixteen miles
between the enclosing hills, gradually narrowing towards
the extremity. Here, on the lowlands adjoining
Annapolis River, is the quaint little town of Annapolis
Royal and the extensive ramparts of the
ancient fort that guarded it, covering some thirty
acres. This was the original French capital of Acadia,
and the first permanent settlement made by Europeans
in America north of St. Augustine, De Monts
founding the colony in 1605. He named it Port
Royal, but the English Puritans a century later
changed this, in honor of their "good Queen Anne,"
to Annapolis Royal. Almost from the first settlement
to the final capture by the Puritan expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
from Boston in 1710, its history was a tale of battles,
sieges and captures by many chieftains of the rival
nations. As the Marquis of Lorne in his Canadian
book describes it: "This is the story which is repeated
with varying incidents through all the long-drawn
coasts of the old Acadia. We see, first, the
forest village of the Red Indians, with its stockades
and patches of maize around it; then the landing
from the ships, under the white flag sown with golden
lilies, of armored arquebussiers and spearsmen; the
skirmishing and the successful French settlement;
to be followed by the coming of other ships, with the
red cross floating over the high-built sterns, and then
the final conflict and the victory of the British arms."
Now everything is peaceful, and the people raise immense
crops of the most attractive apples for shipment
to Europe.</p>

<p>East of Annapolis is the "Garden of Nova Scotia."
The long ridge of the North Mountain on the coast
screens it from the cold winds and fogs, while the
parallel ridge of the South Mountain stretches for
eighty miles, and between these noble ranges, which
are described as "most gracefully moulded," is a
broad and rich intervale extending to the Basin of
Minas and the land of Evangeline, which Longfellow
has made so sadly poetical. Good crops of hay grow
on the fertile red soils, which the farmers gather with
their slowly-plodding ox-teams; and of this region
the poet sang mournfully:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,</p>
<p>Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,</p>
<p>Stand like Druids of old, with voices sad and prophetic,</p>
<p>Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms,</p>
<p>Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced neighboring ocean</p>
<p>Speaks, and in accents disconsolate, answers the wail of the forest."</p>
</div></div>

<p>To-day, however, "the murmuring pines and the
hemlocks" are not there, excepting in stunted growth
in occasional thickets, the land being meadow and
grain fields, with many orchards. Upon a low-lying
peninsula, washed by the placid waters of the Basin
of Minas, is the "Great Meadow," the Grand Pré of
the unfortunate Acadians, where in that early time
they had reclaimed from the enormous tides some
three square miles of land, while south of the
meadow, on somewhat higher ground, was their
little village. Beyond it the dark North Mountain
ridge stretches to the promontory of Cape Blomidon,
dropping off abruptly six hundred feet into the Basin
of Minas. The contented French lived secluded
lives here, avoiding much of the ravages of the wars
raging elsewhere around the Bay of Fundy, and
when France ceded Nova Scotia to England in 1713
they numbered about two thousand. They took the
oaths of loyalty to the British crown, but in the subsequent
French and Indian wars there was much disaffection,
and it was determined in 1755 to remove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
all the French who lived around the Bay of Fundy,
numbering some eight thousand, so that a loyal British
population might replace them. In September
the embarkation began from Grand Pré, one hundred
and sixty young men being ordered aboard ship.
They slowly marched from the church to the shore
between ranks of the women and children, who, kneeling,
prayed for blessings upon them, they also praying
and weeping and singing hymns. The old men
were sent next, but the wives and children were kept
till other ships arrived. These wretched people were
herded together near the sea, without proper food,
raiment or shelter for weeks, until the transports
came, and it was December before the last of them
had embarked. In one locality a hundred men fled
to the woods, and soldiers were sent to hunt them,
often shooting them down. Many in various places
managed to escape, some getting to St. John River,
while not a few went to Quebec, and others found
refuge in Indian wigwams in the forests. There were
seven thousand, however, carried on shipboard from
the Bay of Fundy to the various British colonies
from New Hampshire to Georgia, being landed without
resources and having generally to subsist on
charity. To prevent their returning, all the French
villages around the Bay of Fundy were laid waste
and their homes ruined. In the Minas district two
hundred and fifty houses and a larger number of
barns were burnt. Edmund Burke in the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Parliament cried out against this treatment, saying:
"We did, in my opinion, most inhumanly, and upon
pretences that, in the eye of an honest man, are not
worth a farthing, root out this poor, innocent, deserving
people, whom our utter inability to govern or
to reconcile gave us no sort of right to extirpate."
The sad story of Grand Pré and of Evangeline was
historic before Longfellow's day, but he made it immortal.</p>

<p class="center p2">MINAS TO HALIFAX.</p>

<p>The Basin of Minas, in the Micmac Indian tradition,
was the beaver-pond and favorite abiding-place of
their divinity, Glooscap. On the great promontory of
Cape Blomidon, which stretches northward to enclose
the Basin on its western side, he had his home. The
ridge of the cape turns sharply to the westward and
ends in Cape Split, alongside the Minas Channel.
This formation has been compared to the curved
handle of a huge walking-stick, the long North
Mountain stretching far away being the stick. The
Micmacs tell us that this ridge, now bent around to
the westward, was Glooscap's beaver-dam, which he
beneficently swung open, so that the surplus waters
might run out and not overflow the meadows around
the Basin of Minas. In swinging it around, however,
the terminal cliff of Cape Split was broken off,
and now rises in a promontory four hundred feet
high just beyond the main ridge. Glooscap, we are
told, began a conflict in the Basin with the Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
Beaver, and threw at him the five vast rocks now
known as the Five Islands on the northern shore to
the eastward of Parrsboro'. The Beaver was chased
out of the Basin, westward through the Minas Channel,
and as a parting salute Glooscap threw his kettle at
him, which overturning, became Spencer's Island, on
the northern shore beyond Cape Split. The enormous
tides run through the Minas Channel at eight
miles an hour, and they helped to drive the Great
Beaver over to St. John, where Glooscap finally conquered
and killed him.</p>

<p>The formation around the head of the Bay of
Fundy is largely of rich and fertile red lowlands,
marsh and meadow, much of it being reclaimed by
dyking. The same formation is carried over the
Chignecto isthmus, east of the bay, where the Nova
Scotia Peninsula is joined to the mainland. This is
only seventeen miles wide, and across it has been
projected the "Chignecto Ship Railway," designed
to shorten by about five hundred miles the passage of
vessels around the Nova Scotia Peninsula into the St.
Lawrence. It is a system of railway tracks on
which the design was to carry ships over the isthmus.
Vessels of two thousand tons were to be lifted out of
the water, placed in a huge cradle, and drawn across
by locomotives. The project, estimated as costing
$5,000,000, was stopped in partial completion for
want of funds. On the meadow land to the southward
of the Basin of Minas is Windsor on the Avon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
a small shipping town, in which the most famous
building near the river is a broad and oddly-constructed
one-story house, called the Clifton Mansion,
which was the home of the author of <i>Sam Slick</i>&mdash;Judge
Thomas C. Haliburton, a native of Windsor,
who died in 1865. Beyond is Ardoise Mountain,
rising seven hundred feet and having on its northern
verge the great Aylesford sand-plain whereof <i>Sam
Slick</i> says: "Plain folks call it, in a gin'ral way, the
Devil's Goose Pasture. It is thirteen miles long and
seven miles wide; it ain't just drifting sands, but it's
all but that, it's so barren. It's uneven or wavy, like
the swell of the sea in a calm, and it's covered with
short, thin, dry, coarse grass, and dotted here and
there with a half-starved birch and a stunted, misshapen
spruce. It is just about as silent and lonesome
and desolate a place as you would wish to see.
All that country thereabout, as I have heard tell
when I was a boy, was once owned by the Lord, the
king and the devil. The glebe-lands belonged to the
first, the ungranted wilderness-lands to the second,
and the sand-plain fell to the share of the last&mdash;and
people do say the old gentleman was rather done in
the division, but that is neither here nor there&mdash;and
so it is called to this day the Devil's Goose Pasture."
Over this sand-plain and the rocky, desolate ridge
beyond, runs the great railway train of the Provinces,
on the route between St. John and Halifax&mdash;dignified
by the title of the "Flying Bluenose." It crosses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
the bleak flanks of Ardoise Mountain and Mount
Uniacke, with its gold mines, through a region which
the local chronicler describes as having "admirable
facilities for the pasturage of goats and the procuring
of ballast for breakwaters;" and then comes to the
pleasant shores of Bedford Basin, running several
miles along its beautiful western bank down to Halifax
harbor.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE GREAT BRITISH-AMERICAN FORTRESS.</p>

<p>The city of Halifax is the stronghold of British
power in North America, and is said to be, with the
exception of Gibraltar, the best fortified outpost of
the British empire. It is a fortress and naval station
of magnificent development upon an unrivalled harbor.
This is an arm of the sea, thrust for sixteen
miles up into the land, and the Indians called it Chebucto,
meaning the "chief haven." A thousand
ships can be accommodated on its spacious anchorages.
Its Northwest Arm, a narrow waterway opening
on the western shore just inside the entrance,
makes a long peninsula with water on either side,
which in the centre rises into Citadel Hill, two hundred
and fifty-six feet high. Upon its eastern slopes,
running down to the harbor and spreading two or
three miles along it, is the narrow and elongated
town, having the Queen's Dockyard at the northern
end. Covering the broad hilltop is the spacious
granite Citadel of Fort George, its green slopes, covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
with luxuriant grass, being now devoted to the
peaceful usefulness of a cow-pasture. Along the
harbor and across in the suburb of Dartmouth are
the streets and buildings of the town, containing
forty thousand people. To the southward is the modern
green-covered Fort Charlotte on St. George's
Island, commanding the entrance and looking not
unlike a sugar-loaf hat, and both shores are lined
with powerful batteries and forts that make the position
impregnable. The Citadel was begun by the
Duke of Kent, Queen Victoria's father, when he
commanded the British forces in Canada in the latter
part of the eighteenth century, and it has since been
enlarged and strengthened. At the entrance gate,
grim memorials of the past, are mounted two old
mortars, captured at the downfall of Louisbourg, on
Cape Breton, in 1758.</p>

<p>Halifax did not have an early settlement, though
in the Colonial times the French came into Chebucto
to refit their ships. The Massachusetts Puritans,
who had long been fighting the French and Indians,
first recognized its importance, and in 1748 they sent
a petition to Parliament urging the establishment of
a post there, and $200,000 was voted for a colonizing
expedition, of which the English "Lords of
Trade," George Montagu, Earl of Halifax, being the
chief, took charge, hoping for commercial as well as
military advantage. Lord Edward Cornwallis commanded
the expedition, which brought twenty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
hundred colonists, largely disbanded soldiers, into
Chebucto, landing June 21, 1749, and founding Halifax,
named in honor of the Chief Lord of Trade.
They were soon attacked by the French and Indians,
the suburbs being burnt, and they were harassed in
many ways, leading to the erection of stockades and
forts for defense; but they held the place, and it was
the control of this fine harbor which finally enabled
the British to secure Canada. The fleets and armies
were concentrated here that took and destroyed the
famous fortress of Louisbourg, which, with Quebec,
held the Dominion for the French, and here was also
organized the subsequent expedition under Wolfe
that captured Quebec and ended a century and a
half of warfare by the cession of Canada to England.
In the American Revolution, Halifax was a chief
base of the British operations, and when that war
ended, large numbers of American loyalists exiled
themselves to Halifax. There is now maintained a
garrison of two thousand men and a strong fleet at
Halifax, and the sailor and the soldier are picturesque
features of the streets. The city has pleasant
parks and suburbs, but everything is subordinated to
the grim necessities of the fortress, although in all
its noted career Halifax has never been the scene of
actual warfare.</p>

<p>The Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia is indented by
numerous bays that are good harbors, most of them
having small towns and fishery stations. The western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
portal of Halifax harbor is Chebucto Head and
Cape Sambro, with dangerous shoals beyond. There
have been many serious wrecks in steering for this
entrance during fogs, one of the most awful being
the loss of the steamship "Atlantic" in 1873, when
five hundred and thirty-five persons were drowned.
Westward from Sambro are the broad St. Margaret's
and Mahone Bays, and beyond, Lunenburg on its
spacious harbor, a shipping and fishery town of four
thousand people. To the westward are Bridgewater,
Liverpool and Shelburne, with Cape Sable Island at
the southwestern extremity of Nova Scotia, having
behind it Barrington within a deep harbor. Off
shore is Seal Island, with its great white guiding
light, this being called, from its position, the "Elbow
of the Bay of Fundy," and then around the "Elbow"
is reached the broad estuary of the Tusket River
and the beautiful archipelago of the Tusket Islands.
The Tusket is one of the noted angling and sporting
districts of the Province, this river draining a large
part of the lake region of southwestern Nova Scotia,
and having a succession of lakes connected by rapids
and carrying a large amount of water down to the
sea. There are eighty of these lakes of varying
sizes. The salmon in the spring run up numerously,
and the trout seek the cool recesses of the forests,
while the rapids, the many islands and the charming
woodlands are all attractive. In the archipelago of
the estuary are some three hundred islands, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
group extending out into the sea and having the
powerful tidal currents flowing through their tortuous
passages with the greatest velocity. These islands
vary from small and barren rocks up to larger ones
rising grandly from the water and thickly covered
with trees, the channels between being narrow and
deep. Among these islands are some of the best
lobster fisheries in America.</p>

<p>Eastward from Halifax are more deep bays and
good harbors, but the shores are only sparsely peopled,
being mostly a wilderness yet to be permanently
occupied, though the venturesome fishermen have
their huts dropped about in pleasant nooks. Here
are Musquidoboit and Ship harbors, with Sherbrooke
village in Isaac's harbor. Beyond, the long projecting
peninsula of Guysborough terminates in the
famous Cape Canso, the eastern extremity of Nova
Scotia. This peninsula was named in honor of Sir
Guy Carleton, and has the deep indentation of Chedabucto
Bay on its northern side. Here is a village
of a few hundred sailors and fishermen, where the
French had a fort in the seventeenth century, until
the Puritans under Sir William Phips came from
Boston in 1690, drove them out and burnt it. Off
this coast and ninety miles out at sea to the southward
is the dreaded Sable Island, a long and narrow
sandspit without trees, producing nothing but salt
grass and cranberries. A lighthouse stands at either
end, and there are three flagstaffs for signals at intervals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
between them, with also a life-saving station,
and the bleaching bones of many a wreck imbedded
in the sands. It has few visitors, excepting those
who are cast away, and everyone avoids it. Yet,
strangely enough, the first American explorers were
infatuated with the idea of planting a colony on this
bleak and barren sandbar, and its history has mainly
been a record of wrecks. Cabot originally saw this
island, and in 1508 the first futile attempt was made
to settle it, the colony being soon abandoned, though
some live-stock were left there. Sir Humphrey Gilbert
in 1583 lost his ship "Delight" here, with a
hundred men, and going home on her consort, he lost
his own life on the Azores. It was on this fateful
voyage that Sir Humphrey, on his storm-tossed vessel
"Squirrel," sweeping past the other, shouted to
her crew: "Courage, my lads, we are as near
Heaven by sea as by land." In 1598 a colony of
forty French convicts was placed on the island and
forgotten for seven years, when they were hunted
up and twelve survivors found, whom the King pardoned,
and they were then carried back to France
dressed in seal-skins and described as "gaunt,
squalid and long-bearded." This seems to have
ended the attempts to colonize Sable Island. The
Spaniards sent out an expedition to settle Cape Breton,
but the fleet was dashed to pieces on this island.
The great French Armada, sailing to punish the
Puritans for capturing Louisbourg, suffered severely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
on its shoals. The French afterwards lost there the
frigate "L'Africaine," and later the steamer "Georgia"
was wrecked. It is a long, narrow island, bent
in the form of a bow, spreading twenty-six miles including
the terminating bars, and nowhere over a
mile wide. A long, shallow lake extends for thirteen
miles in the centre. There is the French Garden,
the traditionary spot where the convicts suffered
during their exile, and a graveyard where the shipwrecked
are buried. Wild ponies gallop about, the
descendants of those left by the first settlers, seals
bask on the sands, and ducks swim the lake. Such
to-day is Sable Island.</p>

<p class="center p2">PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.</p>

<p>From Halifax a railroad leads northward across
Nova Scotia to Pictou. It passes through the gold-digging
regions of Waverley, Oldham and Renfrew,
then over the rich red soils of the head of the Bay
of Fundy and down the Shubenacadie River, meaning
the "place of wild potatoes," and reaches Truro,
an active manufacturing town of over five thousand
people near the head of Cobequid Bay. Beyond,
through forests and hills, it crosses the peninsula to
the Pictou coal-fields and comes out on Northumberland
Strait at Pictou harbor. The coal is sent here
for shipment, the name having come from the Indian
word <i>Pictook</i>, meaning "bubbling or gas exploding,"
in allusion to the boiling of the waters near the coal-beds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Over across the Strait is Prince Edward
Island, its red bluff shores along the edge of the
horizon surmounted by a fringe of green foliage.
The Micmacs recognized its peculiarity, calling it
Epayquit, or "Anchored on the Wave." It is one
hundred and thirty miles long and rather narrow,
having deep bays, sometimes almost bisecting the
island. The surface is low and undulating, with fertile
soils mostly derived from the old red sandstone.
The French first called it the Isle de St. Jean, but
after the cession to England an effort was made to
call it New Ireland, as Nova Scotia was New Scotland,
and finally in 1800 it was given the present
name in honor of Queen Victoria's father. It raises
horses, oats, eggs and potatoes, and relatively to size
is the best populated of all the Maritime Provinces.
Charlottetown, inside of Hillsborough Bay,&mdash;called
popularly "Ch-town," for short,&mdash;is the capital, a
quiet place with about eleven thousand population,
the Parliament House being its best building. A
narrow-gauge railway is constructed through the
island, near its western terminal being Summerside,
on Bedeque Bay, where there is a little trade and
three thousand people, probably its most active port.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE ARM OF GOLD.</p>

<p>The eastern boundary of Nova Scotia is the Canso
Strait, separating it from Cape Breton Island. At
Canso, its southern entrance, various Atlantic cables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
are landed, while others go off southward to New
York. This strait is a picturesque waterway, fifteen
miles long and about a mile wide, a highway of commerce
for the shipping desirous of avoiding the long
passage around Cape Breton, and it is called by its
admirers "The Golden Gate of the St. Lawrence
Gulf." The geologists describe it as a narrow transverse
valley excavated by the powerful currents of
the drift period. As it leads directly from the Atlantic
Ocean into the Gulf, more vessels are said to
pass it than any other strait excepting Gibraltar. It
has several villages upon the shores, mainly with
Scottish inhabitants, the chief being Port Hawkesbury,
Port Mulgrave and Port Hastings, the latter a
point for gypsum export. Cape Breton Island is
about one hundred miles long and eighty miles wide,
its greatest natural feature being the famous "Arm
of Gold," thus named in admiration by the early
French explorers. Nearly one-half the surface of
the island is occupied by the lakes and swamps of
this "Bras d'Or," an extensive and almost tideless
inland sea of salt water, ramifying with deep bays
and long arms through the centre, having two large
openings into the sea at its northeastern end, and
almost communicating with the Atlantic on its southwestern
corner. This "Arm of Gold" has fine
scenery, and presents within the rocky confines of
the island a large lake, the Great Bras d'Or, where
the mariner gets almost out of sight of land. To the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
southward of Cape Breton Island is Arichat, or the
Isle Madame, having the Lennox Passage between,
this Isle being inhabited by a colony of French Acadian
fishermen. Originally this region was colonized
by the Count de Fronsac, Sieur Denys, the
first French Governor of Cape Breton, in whose
honor they always called the Canso Strait the Passage
Fronsac, though since then its present title was
adopted, being derived from the Micmac name of
Camsoke, meaning "facing the frowning cliffs."
Each little French settlement here, as on the St.
Lawrence, has the white cottages clustering around
the church with the tall spire, and the curé's house
not far away, usually the most elaborate in the settlement.
From the Lennox Passage a short canal
has been cut through the rocks into the southwestern
extremity of the Bras d'Or, thus actually dividing
Cape Breton into two islands.</p>

<p>The village of "St. Peter at the Gate" is passed,
and the lake entered at St. Peter's Inlet, a beautiful
waterway filled with islands making narrow winding
channels. Several of these islands are a Government
reservation for a remnant of the Micmacs, and
they have a small white church upon Chapel Island,
where they gather from all parts of Cape Breton for
their annual festival on St. Anne's Day. Beyond,
the Great Bras d'Or broadens, an inland sea, the opposite
shore almost out of vision, for the lake is
eighteen miles across and fully fifty miles long. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
banks come together at the Grand Narrows, making
the contracted Strait of Barra, and then they expand
again into another lake, neither so long nor so wide,
the Little Bras d'Or to the northeastward, but still
nearly fifty miles long, including its northeastern
prolongation of St. Andrew Channel. This in turn
opens by a wider strait into yet another lake to the
northward, upon the farther shore of which is Baddeck.
To the westward this lake spreads into St.
Patrick's Channel, and to the northeastward there
are thrust out in parallel lines the two "Arms of
Gold" connecting with the sea. An island over
thirty miles long and varying in width separates these
two curious arms. These strangely-fashioned lakes
present varied scenery; the shores in some places
are low meadows, in others gently-swelling hills, and
elsewhere they rise into forest-clad mountains. In
the pellucid waters swim jelly-fish of exquisite tints.
The atmosphere blends the outlines and colors so
well that it smoothes the roughness of the wilder regions,
and casts a softness over the scene which
adds to its charms. Beyond the bordering mountains,
to the northward, is a dreary and almost uninhabited
table-land stretching to the Atlantic Ocean,
where the long projection of remote Cape North
stands in silent grandeur within seventy-five miles
of Newfoundland.</p>

<p>Upon the verge of the northern Bras d'Or Lake,
in a charming situation, is the little town of Baddeck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
its houses scattered over the sloping hillsides and
the church spires rising among the trees. A pretty
island stands out in front as a protective breakwater,
for storms often sweep wildly across the broad waters.
This is the chief settlement of the lake district, the
Highland Scottish inhabitants having twisted its
present name out of the original French title of
Bedique, there being a population of about one thousand.
At the eastern extremity of Cape Breton
Island, on an inlet from the Atlantic, and near the
terminating arms of the Bras d'Or, is the coal-shipping
port of Sydney, with a population of twenty-five
hundred, though excepting coal-piers and colliers
there is not much there to see. This is the port
for the Sydney coal-fields, covering nearly three
hundred square miles of the island, and the mine-galleries
being prolonged in various places under the
ocean. These were the first coal deposits worked
in America, the French having got coal out of them
in the seventeenth century. They are now all controlled
by the wealthy Dominion Coal Company of
Boston. Sydney, C. B., is a seaport known from its
coaling facilities throughout the world, and while prosaic
enough now, it saw stirring scenes in the Colonial
times. The early name for its admirable harbor
was Spanish Bay, because Spanish fishermen gathered
there. It was a favorite anchorage for both
French and English fleets in their preparations, as
the tide of battle turned, for attacking New England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
or Acadia in the long struggle for supremacy. In
1696 the French assembled in Spanish Bay for a
foray upon Pemaquid. In 1711 Admiral Hovenden
Walker, returning from his unsuccessful expedition
against Quebec, his ships having been dispersed by
a storm, collected in this capacious roadstead the
most formidable fleet it had seen, forty-two vessels.
The doughty British Admiral felt so good about it
that he set up on shore a large signboard made by
his carpenters, whereon was inscribed a pompous
proclamation claiming possession of the whole country
in honor of his sovereign Queen Anne. The
French soon came along, however, and smashed his
signboard, built their fortress of Louisbourg, and
there was a half-century of warfare before the proclamation
was made good and England had undisputed
possession. The settlement on Spanish Bay was not
named after Lord Sydney and made the Cape Breton
capital until 1784, when exiled loyalists came from
the United States to inhabit it.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE GREAT ACADIAN FORTRESS.</p>

<p>Upon the seacoast, twenty-five miles southeast of
Sydney, is a low headland with a dark rocky island
in the offing. This headland is Cape Breton, originally
named for the Breton French fishermen who
frequented it, and it in turn named Cape Breton
Island. Just west of Cape Breton is an admirable
harbor which, being frequented in the early days by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
English fishermen, the French named the <i>Havre aux
Anglais</i>, or the "English Port." Upon Point Rochefort,
on its western side, stood the famous French
fortress and town of Louisbourg, which was called
"the Dunkirk of America." While grass-grown
ruins and some of the ramparts are still traceable,
and visitors find relics, yet little is left of this great
fortress, once regarded as the "Key to New France,"
or of the populous French town on the harbor which
in the eighteenth century had a trade of the first
importance. It was twice captured, after remarkable
sieges and battles of world-wide renown, causing
the most profound sensations at the time, and now
absolutely nothing is left of the original place but an
old graveyard on the point, where French and English
dust commingle in peace under a mantle of dark
greensward. There is at present a settlement of
about a thousand people around the harbor, mainly
engaged in the fisheries. The Treaty of Utrecht in
1713 transferred Newfoundland and Acadia from
France to England, but the French held Cape Breton
Island, and many of their refugees came hither.
It was not long before the French King, Louis
XIV., stirred by Admiral Walker's proclamation and
anxious about Canada, determined to fortify the
"English Port" and make a commercial depot there,
and in 1714 the plan was laid out, the name being
changed to Louisbourg. In 1720 work began on a
prodigious scale, the intention being to make it the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
leading fortress in America, and for more than
twenty years France devoted its energy and resources
to the completion of the stupendous fortifications,
attracting inhabitants to the place by bounties,
and creating a brisk trade by sea which soon
drew inhabitants for a large town. When completed,
this town stood upon the neck of land on the southwest
side of the harbor enclosed by stone walls having
a circuit of nearly three miles. These walls
were thirty-six feet high and forty feet thick at the
base, with a ditch outside eighty feet wide. The
fortress was constructed in the first system of the
noted French engineer, Vauban, and required a
large garrison. A battery of thirty guns was located
on Goat Island, at the harbor entrance, and at the
bottom of the harbor opposite the entrance was another,
the Royal Battery, also of thirty guns. The
land and harbor sides of the town were defended by
ramparts and bastions on which eighty guns were
mounted, the land side also having a deep moat and
projecting bastions, the West Gate on that side being
overlooked by a battery of sixteen guns. There
was a ponderous Citadel, and in the centre of the
town the stately stone church of St. John de Dieu,
with attendant nunnery and hospitals. The streets
crossed at right angles, and five gates in the walls on
the harbor side communicated with the wharves.
Such was the greatest stronghold in North America
in 1745, the famous Louisbourg fortress.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>The people of New England, whose commerce was
being preyed upon by privateers which found refuge
in its harbor, and whose frontiers were harassed
by forays thence directed, we are told by the historian,
"looked with awe upon the sombre walls of
Louisbourg, whose towers rose like giants above the
northern seas." But the Puritans were not wont to
lie still under such inflictions, nor to confine their
efforts to prayers alone. Massachusetts planned an
attack, and the command of the expedition was given
William Pepperell of Kittery, a merchant ignorant
of the art of war. Then followed one of the most
extraordinary events in history. A fleet of about a
hundred vessels carried a force of forty-one hundred
undisciplined militia upon a Puritan crusade, which
was started with religious services, the eloquent
preacher, George Whitefield, imploring a blessing
and giving them the motto, <i>Nil desperandum, Christo
duce</i>. They rendezvoused at Canso, meeting there
Commodore Warren and the British West Indian
fleet by arrangement, and landing at Gabarus Bay,
west of Louisbourg, April 30, 1745. They did
not know much about war, but they set fire to some
storehouses, and the black smoke drove down in
such volumes upon the Royal Battery at the bottom
of the harbor that its scared French defenders
spiked the guns and fled in the night. The Puritans
took possession, beat off the French who attacked
them, got smiths at work, who drilled out the spikes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
and soon from this, the key to the position, they
turned the guns upon the town. Then began a
regular siege, though most unscientific in manner.
They captured a French ship with stores and reinforcements,
and by June had breached the walls
twenty-four feet at the King's Bastion, dismounted
all the neighboring guns, made the Goat Island Battery
untenable, and ruined the town by showers of
bombs and red-hot balls. Upon June 15th the
British fleet of ten ships was drawn up off the harbor
entrance for an attack, and the land forces were
arrayed to assault the West Gate, when the French
commander, knowing he could hold out no longer,
decided to surrender, and on June 17th, the forty-ninth
day of the siege, he capitulated.</p>

<p>Thus the grand fortress fell, as the Puritan historian
describes it, upon the attack of "four thousand
undisciplined militia or volunteers, officered by men
who had, with one or two exceptions, never seen a
shot fired in anger in all their lives, encamped in an
open country and sadly deficient in suitable artillery."
He continues: "As the troops, entering the
fortress, beheld the strength of the place, their hearts
for the first time sank within them. 'God has gone
out of his way,' said they, 'in a remarkable and
most miraculous manner, to incline the hearts of the
French to give up and deliver this strong city into
our hands.'" The capture was the marvel of the
time, and caused the greatest rejoicings throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
the British Empire; while Pepperell, who was made
a Baronet, attributed his success, not to the guns nor
the ships, but to the constant prayers of New England,
daily arising from every village in behalf of the
absent army. This victory at Louisbourg gave them
an experience to which is attributed the American
success at Bunker Hill thirty years afterwards.
Colonel Gridley, who planned Pepperell's batteries,
is said to have laid out the hastily constructed entrenchments
on Bunker Hill, and the same old drums
that beat in the siege of Louisbourg were at Bunker
Hill, the spirit which this great victory imparted to
the Yankee soldiers having never deteriorated.</p>

<p>The French were terribly chagrined at the loss of
their great fortress, and in 1746 they sent out the
"French Armada" of seventy ships under the Duc
d'Anville, instructed to "occupy Louisbourg, reduce
Nova Scotia, destroy Boston, and ravage the coast
of New England." But storms wrecked and dispersed
the fleet, and the vexed and disappointed
commander died of apoplexy, his Vice-Admiral killing
himself. Then a second expedition of forty-four
ships was sent under La Jonquiere to retake Louisbourg,
but the English squadrons attacked and destroyed
this fleet off Cape Finisterre, Admirals Warren
and Anson gaining one of the greatest British
naval victories of the eighteenth century. The fortress
which thus could not be retaken by arms was,
however, to the general astonishment, surrendered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
back to France by diplomacy. The peace of Aix
la Chapelle in 1748 ended the war by restoring
Louisbourg and Cape Breton Island to France, and
the historian bluntly records that "after four years
of warfare in all parts of the world, after all the
waste of blood and treasure, the war ended just
where it began." France then rebuilt, improved and
strengthened the idolized fortress, sending it a powerful
garrison.</p>

<p>War was renewed in 1755,&mdash;the terrible French
and Indian War. Halifax was then the base of
British-American operations, and fleets soon blockaded
Louisbourg. The French had twelve warships
in the harbor and ten thousand men in the garrison,
but the British, bewailing the shortsightedness that
gave it up by treaty, were bound to retake it at all
hazards. They sent a fleet of one hundred and fifty-six
warships and transports from Spithead, the most
powerful England had down to that time assembled,
carrying thirteen thousand six hundred men, with
Admiral Boscawen commanding the navy and General
Amherst the army, the immortal Wolfe being
one of the brigadiers. Rendezvousing at Halifax,
this great force sailed against Louisbourg May 28,
1758, the troops landing at Gabarus Bay, and beginning
the attack June 8th, with Wolfe leading. The
French commander sank five of his warships to
blockade the harbor entrance. Wolfe closely followed
Pepperell's method, got batteries in position to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
bombard the city, and silenced the Goat Island Battery
by his tremendous cannonade. In time he had
destroyed the West Gate, the Citadel and barracks,
and burnt three of the French ships by his red-hot
balls. Two more ships ran out of the harbor in a
fog to escape, and one was captured. Two French
frigates alone remained, and a daring attack in boats
was made on these, and both were destroyed.
Breaches were rent in the walls, so that the place
became untenable, and finally, after forty-eight days
of terrific siege, Louisbourg, on July 26th, again surrendered
to the British. Then more rejoicings came
throughout the Empire, Wolfe was made a Major
General, and the gain to ocean commerce by the
downfall of the fortress, which had been a refuge for
privateers, was seen in an immediate decline in marine
insurance rates from thirty to twelve per cent.
The next year the great British fleet and army sailed
away from Louisbourg under Wolfe for the capture
of Quebec and the final conquest of Canada. Then
went forth the edict of the conqueror that the famous
French fortress should be utterly destroyed. It was
found as a seaport to be inferior to Halifax, where
the admirable harbor is never closed by ice, and
where the forts could make the place impregnable.
The Louisbourg garrison was withdrawn, and the
people scattered, many going to Sydney. All the
guns, stores and everything valuable went to Halifax.
In 1760 a corps of sappers and miners worked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
six months, demolishing the fortifications and buildings,
overthrowing the walls and glacis into the
ditches, leaving nothing standing but a few small
half-ruined private houses, and thus the proud Acadian
fortress was humbled into heaps of rubbish.
The merciful hand of time, left to complete the
ruin, has during the centuries healed most of the
ghastly wounds with its generous mantle of greensward,
and the neighboring ocean sounds along the
low shores the eternal requiem of proud Louisbourg.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE MAGDALEN ISLANDS.</p>

<p>We have come to the uttermost verge of the Continent
in quest of "Down East," and find it elusive
and still beyond us. There is yet the remote island
of Newfoundland, and we are pointed thither as still
"Down East." To the northward, lying in the
Gulf of St. Lawrence, are the group of Magdalen
Islands, where a steamer calls once a week, sailing
from Pictou, these probably being about as far away
as one would wish to go in his search. There are
thirteen in the group, sixty miles off the extremity
of Cape Breton Island, the bleak Cape North. Acadian
fishermen live there, the population being about
three thousand, and New England fishery fleets visit
them for cod, mackerel and seals, with lobsters and
sea-trout also abundant, so that these islands have
come to be called in the Provinces the "Kingdom of
Fish." Amherst Island is the chief, having the village
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
and Custom House, the surface of this and
other islands rising in high hills seen from afar.
Coffin Island is the largest of the group, named after
Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, the original owner. Coffin
was a native of Boston, and in colonial times a distinguished
British naval officer. When he was a
Captain he took Governor General Lord Dorchester
to Canada in his frigate, and designing to enter the
St. Lawrence, a furious storm arose. With skill he
saved his vessel by managing to get under the lee
of these islands, which broke the force of the gale,
and Lord Dorchester in gratitude procured the grant
of the group for Coffin. There are also the Bird
Isles, two bare rocks of sandstone, the principal one
called the Gannet Rock. These are haunted by immense
numbers of sea-birds, whose eggs the islanders
gather. The surf dashes violently against the gaunt
rocks on all sides, and they have been visited by the
greatest naturalists of the world, who found them a
most interesting study. A lighthouse is erected on
one of them. Charlevoix, in 1720, recorded his
visit here, and his wonder how "in such a multitude
of nests every bird immediately finds her own." It
is also recorded of this remote region that it, too, is
a colonizer, the people of the Magdalen Islands having
established three small but prosperous colonies
over on the Labrador shore. Outlying the group to
the westward, eight miles from Amherst, is the desolate
rock, resembling a corpse prepared for burial,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
known as Deadman's Isle. Tom Moore sailed past
this gruesome place in 1804, and wrote the poem
making it famous:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"There lieth a wreck on the dismal shore</p>
<p>Of cold and pitiless Labrador,</p>
<p>Where, under the moon, upon mounts of frost,</p>
<p>Full many a mariner's bones are tossed.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Yon shadowy bark hath been to that wreck,</p>
<p>And the dim blue fire that lights her deck</p>
<p>Doth play on as pale and livid a crew</p>
<p>As ever yet drank the churchyard dew.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"To Deadman's Isle in the eye of the blast,</p>
<p>To Deadman's Isle she speeds her fast;</p>
<p>By skeleton shapes her sails are furled,</p>
<p>And the hand that steers is not of this world."</p>
